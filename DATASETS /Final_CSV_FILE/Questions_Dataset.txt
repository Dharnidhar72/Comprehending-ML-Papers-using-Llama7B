We trained the model with the following four combinations of the datasets: AL, AL+CA+CO (two proposed models), ACP (supervised), and ACP+AL+CA+CO (semi-supervised). The corresponding objective functions were: $\mathcal {L}_{\rm AL}$, $\mathcal {L}_{\rm AL} + \mathcal {L}_{\rm CA} + \mathcal {L}_{\rm CO}$, $\mathcal {L}_{\rm ACP}$, and $\mathcal {L}_{\rm ACP} + \mathcal {L}_{\rm AL} + \mathcal {L}_{\rm CA} + \mathcal {L}_{\rm CO}$. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Minimally Supervised Learning of Affective Events Using Discourse Relations, How are relations used to propagate polarity? [/INST] The key idea is that we can exploit discourse relations BIBREF4 to efficiently propagate polarity from seed predicates that directly report one's emotions (e.g., â€œto be gladâ€ is positive). Suppose that events $x_1$ are $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Cause (i.e., $x_1$ causes $x_2$). If the seed lexicon suggests $x_2$ is positive, $x_1$ is also likely to be positive because it triggers the positive emotion. The fact that $x_2$ is known to be negative indicates the negative polarity of $x_1$. Similarly, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Concession (i.e., $x_2$ in spite of $x_1$), the reverse of $x_2$'s polarity can be propagated to $x_1$. Even if $x_2$'s polarity is not known in advance, we can exploit the tendency of $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be of the same polarity (for Cause) or of the reverse polarity (for Concession) although the heuristic is not exempt from counterexamples. We transform this idea into objective functions and train neural network models that predict the polarity of a given event. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Community Identity and User Engagement in a Multi-Community Landscape, How do the various social phenomena examined manifest in different types of communities?

Similarly, more distinctive communities, like Cooking and Naruto, exhibit moderately higher monthly retention rates than more generic communities (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.33, INLINEFORM3 0.001; Figure FIGREF11 .A, right).
As with monthly retention, we find a strong positive relationship between a community's dynamicity and the average number of months that a user will stay in that community (Spearman's INLINEFORM0 = 0.41, INLINEFORM1 0.001, computed over all community points; Figure FIGREF11 .B, left). This verifies that the short-term trend observed for monthly retention translates into longer-term engagement and suggests that long-term user retention might be strongly driven by the extent to which a community continually provides novel content. Interestingly, there is no significant relationship between distinctiveness and long-term engagement (Spearman's INLINEFORM2 = 0.03, INLINEFORM3 0.77; Figure FIGREF11 .B, right).

<s>[INST] In the paper Question Answering based Clinical Text Structuring Using Pre-trained Language Model, How is the clinical text structuring task defined? [/INST] Clinical text structuring (CTS) is a critical task for fetching medical research data from electronic health records (EHRs), where structural patient medical data, such as whether the patient has specific symptoms, diseases, or what the tumor size is, how far from the tumor is cut at during the surgery, or what the specific laboratory test result is, are obtained. It is important to extract structured data from clinical text because bio-medical systems or bio-medical researches greatly rely on structured data but they cannot obtain them directly. In addition, clinical text often contains abundant healthcare information. CTS is able to provide large-scale extracted structured data for enormous down-stream clinical researches.
Unlike the traditional CTS task, our QA-CTS task aims to discover the most related text from original paragraph text. For some cases, it is already the final answer in deed (e.g., extracting sub-string). While for other cases, it needs several steps to obtain the final answer, such as entity names conversion and negative words recognition. Our presented QA-CTS task unifies the output format of the traditional CTS task and make the training data shareable, thus enriching the training data.  </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Probabilistic Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings, How is embedding quality assessed? [/INST] We evaluate our framework on fastText embeddings trained on Wikipedia (2017), UMBC webbase corpus and statmt.org news dataset (16B tokens) BIBREF11. For simplicity, only the first 22000 words are used in all embeddings, though preliminary results indicate the findings extend to the full corpus. For our novel methods of mitigating bias, a shallow neural network is used to adjust the embedding. The single layer of the model is an embedding layer with weights initialized to those of the original embedding. For the composite method, these weights are initialized to those of the embedding after probabilistic bias mitigation. A batch of word indices is fed into the model, which are then embedded and for which a loss value is calculated, allowing back-propagation to adjust the embeddings. For each of the models, a fixed number of iterations is used to prevent overfitting, which can eventually hurt performance on the embedding benchmarks (See Figure FIGREF12). We evaluated the embedding after 1000 iterations, and stopped training if performance on a benchmark decreased significantly.
We construct a list of candidate words to debias, taken from the words used in the WEAT gender bias statistics. Words in this list should be gender neutral, and are related to the topics of career, arts, science, math, family and professions (see appendix). We note that this list can easily be expanded to include a greater proportion of words in the corpus. For example, BIBREF4 suggested a method for identifying inappropriately gendered words using unsupervised learning.
We compare this method of bias mitigation with the no bias mitigation ("Orig"), geometric bias mitigation ("Geo"), the two pieces of our method alone ("Prob" and "KNN") and the composite method ("KNN+Prob"). We note that the composite method performs reasonably well according the the RIPA metric, and much better than traditional geometric bias mitigation according to the neighborhood metric, without significant performance loss according to the accepted benchmarks. To our knowledge this is the first bias mitigation method to perform reasonably both on both metrics. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Probabilistic Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings, What are the three measures of bias which are reduced in experiments? [/INST] Geometric bias mitigation uses the cosine distances between words to both measure and remove gender bias BIBREF0.
The WEAT statistic BIBREF1 demonstrates the presence of biases in word embeddings with an effect size defined as the mean test statistic across the two word sets:
Where as, the test statistic, is defined as: $s(w,A,B) = mean_{a \in A} cos(w,a) - mean_{b \in B} cos(w,a)$, and $X$,$Y$,$A$, and $B$ are groups of words for which the association is measured.
The RIPA (relational inner product association) metric was developed as an alternative to WEAT, with the critique that WEAT is likely to overestimate the bias of a target attribute BIBREF4. 
The neighborhood bias metric proposed by BIBREF5 quantifies bias as the proportion of male socially-biased words among the $k$ nearest socially-biased male and female neighboring words, whereby biased words are obtained by projecting neutral words onto a gender relation vector. </s>

Given a set of contexts of a polysemous word, the participants of the competition had to divide them into clusters by sense of the word. The contexts are manually labelled with WordNet senses of the target words, the gold standard clustering is generated from this labelling.

[/INST] We modeled the relationship between word count and the two metrics of user engagement (overall rating, mean number of turns) in separate linear regressions.

Results showed that users who, on average, produced utterances with more words gave significantly higher ratings ($\beta $=0.01, SE=0.002, t=4.79, p$<$0.001)(see Figure 2) and engaged with Gunrock for significantly greater number of turns ($\beta $=1.85, SE=0.05, t=35.58, p$<$0.001) (see Figure 2). These results can be interpreted as evidence for Gunrock's ability to handle complex sentences, where users are not constrained to simple responses to be understood and feel engaged in the conversation â€“ and evidence that individuals are more satisfied with the conversation when they take a more active role, rather than the system dominating the dialog. On the other hand, another interpretation is that users who are more talkative may enjoy talking to the bot in general, and thus give higher ratings in tandem with higher average word counts. </s>

Class Distinction Test: this is the reciprocal of the previous Class Membership test. Embeddings of elements of different classes should be different, since words of different classes ere expected to be found in significantly different contexts.

Word Equivalence Test: embeddings corresponding to synonyms, antonyms, abbreviations (e.g. â€œporque" abbreviated by â€œpq") and partial references (e.g. â€œslb and benfica") should be almost equal, since both alternatives are supposed to be used be interchangeable in all contexts (either maintaining or inverting the meaning).

Therefore, in our tests, two words are considered:

distinct if the cosine of the corresponding embeddings is lower than 0.70 (or 0.80).

to belong to the same class if the cosine of their embeddings is higher than 0.70 (or 0.80).

equivalent if the cosine of the embeddings is higher that 0.85 (or 0.95). </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Active Learning for Chinese Word Segmentation in Medical Text, How does the scoring model work? [/INST] To select the most appropriate sentences in a large number of unlabeled corpora, we propose a scoring model based on information entropy and neural network as the sampling strategy of active learning, which is inspired by Cai and Zhao BIBREF32 . The score of a segmented sentence is computed as follows. First, mapping the segmented sentence to a sequence of candidate word embeddings. Then, the scoring model takes the word embedding sequence as input, scoring over each individual candidate word from two perspectives: (1) the possibility that the candidate word itself can be regarded as a legal word; (2) the rationality of the link that the candidate word directly follows previous segmentation history. Fig. FIGREF10 illustrates the entire scoring model. A gated neural network is employed over character embeddings to generate distributed representations of candidate words, which are sent to a LSTM model. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Active Learning for Chinese Word Segmentation in Medical Text, How does the active learning model work? [/INST] Active learning methods can generally be described into two parts: a learning engine and a selection engine BIBREF28 . The learning engine is essentially a classifier, which is mainly used for training of classification problems. The selection engine is based on the sampling strategy, which chooses samples that need to be relabeled by annotators from unlabeled data. Then, relabeled samples are added to training set for classifier to re-train, thus continuously improving the accuracy of the classifier. In this paper, a CRF-based segmenter and a scoring model are employed as learning engine and selection engine, respectively. </s>

Here, we demonstrate another potential use of adversarial modifications: finding erroneous triples in the knowledge graph. Intuitively, if there is an error in the graph, the triple is likely to be inconsistent with its neighborhood, and thus the model should put least trust on this triple. In other words, the error triple should have the least influence on the model's prediction of the training data. Formally, to find the incorrect triple $\langle s^{\prime }, r^{\prime }, o\rangle $ in the neighborhood of the train triple $\langle s, r, o\rangle $ , we need to find the triple $\langle s^{\prime },r^{\prime },o\rangle $ that results in the least change $\Delta _{(s^{\prime },r^{\prime })}(s,r,o)$ when removed from the graph. </s>

Not surprisingly, the svi version converges much faster to higher values of the log marginal likelihood when compared to the batch version, which reflects the efficiency of the svi algorithm. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Learning Supervised Topic Models for Classification and Regression from Crowds, what are the state of the art approaches? [/INST] With the purpose of comparing the proposed model with a popular state-of-the-art approach for image classification, for the LabelMe dataset, the following baseline was introduced:

Bosch 2006 (mv): This baseline is similar to one in BIBREF33 . The authors propose the use of pLSA to extract the latent topics, and the use of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier using the documents' topics distributions. For this baseline, unsupervised LDA is used instead of pLSA, and the labels from the different annotators for kNN (with INLINEFORM0 ) are aggregated using majority voting (mv).

The results obtained by the different approaches for the LabelMe data are shown in Fig. FIGREF94 , where the svi version is using mini-batches of 200 documents.

Analyzing the results for the Reuters-21578 and LabelMe data, we can observe that MA-sLDAc outperforms all the baselines, with slightly better accuracies for the batch version, especially in the Reuters data. Interestingly, the second best results are consistently obtained by the multi-annotator approaches, which highlights the need for accounting for the noise and biases of the answers of the different annotators.
Both the batch and the stochastic variational inference (svi) versions of the proposed model (MA-sLDAc) are compared with the following baselines:

[itemsep=0.02cm]

LDA + LogReg (mv): This baseline corresponds to applying unsupervised LDA to the data, and learning a logistic regression classifier on the inferred topics distributions of the documents. The labels from the different annotators were aggregated using majority voting (mv). Notice that, when there is a single annotator label per instance, majority voting is equivalent to using that label for training. This is the case of the 20-Newsgroups' simulated annotators, but the same does not apply for the experiments in Section UID89 .

LDA + Raykar: For this baseline, the model of BIBREF21 was applied using the documents' topic distributions inferred by LDA as features.

LDA + Rodrigues: This baseline is similar to the previous one, but uses the model of BIBREF9 instead.

Blei 2003 (mv): The idea of this baseline is to replicate a popular state-of-the-art approach for document classification. Hence, the approach of BIBREF0 was used. It consists of applying LDA to extract the documents' topics distributions, which are then used to train a SVM. Similarly to the previous approach, the labels from the different annotators were aggregated using majority voting (mv).

sLDA (mv): This corresponds to using the classification version of sLDA BIBREF2 with the labels obtained by performing majority voting (mv) on the annotators' answers. </s>

We assume that the language-specific component is similar across all sentences in the language. We use a pre-trained mBERT model that was made public with the BERT release. The model dimension is 768, hidden layer dimension 3072, self-attention uses 12 heads, the model has 12 layers. It uses a vocabulary of 120k wordpieces that is shared for all languages. To train the language identification classifier, for each of the BERT languages we randomly selected 110k sentences of at least 20 characters from Wikipedia, and keep 5k for validation and 5k for testing for each language. The training data are also used for estimating the language centroids. Word Alignment.The word-alignment based on mBERT representations surpasses the outputs of the standard FastAlign tool even if it was provided large parallel corpus.

We note two possible approaches to this end:

Across models and tasks: The degree (as grayscale) of faithfulness at the level of specific models and tasks. Perhaps some models or tasks allow sufficiently faithful interpretation, even if the same is not true for others.

For example, the method may not be faithful for some question-answering task, but faithful for movie review sentiment, perhaps based on various syntactic and semantic attributes of those tasks.

Across input space: The degree of faithfulness at the level of subspaces of the input space, such as neighborhoods of similar inputs, or singular inputs themselves.

[/INST] We propose the following challenge to the community: We must develop formal definition and evaluation for faithfulness that allows us the freedom to say when a method is sufficiently faithful to be useful in practice.

We note two possible approaches to this end:

Across models and tasks: The degree (as grayscale) of faithfulness at the level of specific models and tasks. Perhaps some models or tasks allow sufficiently faithful interpretation, even if the same is not true for others.

For example, the method may not be faithful for some question-answering task, but faithful for movie review sentiment, perhaps based on various syntactic and semantic attributes of those tasks.

Across input space: The degree of faithfulness at the level of subspaces of the input space, such as neighborhoods of similar inputs, or singular inputs themselves. If we are able to say with some degree of confidence whether a specific decision's explanation is faithful to the model, even if the interpretation method is not considered universally faithful, it can be used with respect to those specific areas or instances only. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Towards Faithfully Interpretable NLP Systems: How should we define and evaluate faithfulness?, Which are three assumptions in current approaches for defining faithfulness? [/INST] Defining Faithfulness ::: Assumption 1 (The Model Assumption).
Two models will make the same predictions if and only if they use the same reasoning process.
Defining Faithfulness ::: Assumption 2 (The Prediction Assumption).
On similar inputs, the model makes similar decisions if and only if its reasoning is similar.
Defining Faithfulness ::: Assumption 3 (The Linearity Assumption).
Certain parts of the input are more important to the model reasoning than others. Moreover, the contributions of different parts of the input are independent from each other. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Towards Faithfully Interpretable NLP Systems: How should we define and evaluate faithfulness?, Which are key points in guidelines for faithfulness evaluation? [/INST] Guidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness
We propose the following guidelines for evaluating the faithfulness of explanations. These guidelines address common pitfalls and sub-optimal practices we observed in the literature.

Guidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Be explicit in what you evaluate.
Conflating plausability and faithfulness is harmful. You should be explicit on which one of them you evaluate, and use suitable methodologies for each one. Of course, the same applies when designing interpretation techniquesâ€”be clear about which properties are being prioritized.

Guidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Faithfulness evaluation should not involve human-judgement on the quality of interpretation.
We note that: (1) humans cannot judge if an interpretation is faithful or not: if they understood the model, interpretation would be unnecessary; (2) for similar reasons, we cannot obtain supervision for this problem, either. Therefore, human judgement should not be involved in evaluation for faithfulness, as human judgement measures plausability.

Guidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Faithfulness evaluation should not involve human-provided gold labels.
We should be able to interpret incorrect model predictions, just the same as correct ones. Evaluation methods that rely on gold labels are influenced by human priors on what should the model do, and again push the evaluation in the direction of plausability.

Guidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Do not trust â€œinherent interpretabilityâ€ claims.
Inherent interpretability is a claim until proven otherwise. Explanations provided by â€œinherently interpretableâ€ models must be held to the same standards as post-hoc interpretation methods, and be evaluated for faithfulness using the same set of evaluation techniques.

Guidelines for Evaluating Faithfulness ::: Faithfulness evaluation of IUI systems should not rely on user performance.
End-task user performance in HCI settings is merely indicative of correlation between plausibility and model performance, however small this correlation is. While important to evaluate the utility of the interpretations for some use-cases, it is unrelated to faithfulness. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper SUM-QE: a BERT-based Summary Quality Estimation Model, What dataset do they use? [/INST] We use datasets from the NIST DUC-05, DUC-06 and DUC-07 shared tasks BIBREF7, BIBREF19, BIBREF20. Given a question and a cluster of newswire documents, the contestants were asked to generate a 250-word summary answering the question. DUC-05 contains 1,600 summaries (50 questions x 32 systems); in DUC-06, 1,750 summaries are included (50 questions x 35 systems); and DUC-07 has 1,440 summaries (45 questions x 32 systems). </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper SUM-QE: a BERT-based Summary Quality Estimation Model, What simpler models do they look at? [/INST] Methods ::: Baselines ::: BiGRU s with attention:
This is very similar to Sum-QE but now $\mathcal {E}$ is a stack of BiGRU s with self-attention BIBREF21, instead of a BERT instance. The final summary representation ($h$) is the sum of the resulting context-aware token embeddings ($h = \sum _i a_i h_i$) weighted by their self-attention scores ($a_i$). We again have three flavors: one single-task (BiGRU-ATT-S-1) and two multi-task (BiGRU-ATT-M-1 and BiGRU-ATT-M-5).

Methods ::: Baselines ::: ROUGE:
This baseline is the ROUGE version that performs best on each dataset, among the versions considered by BIBREF13. Although ROUGE focuses on surface similarities between peer and reference summaries, we would expect properties like grammaticality, referential clarity and coherence to be captured to some extent by ROUGE versions based on long $n$-grams or longest common subsequences.

Methods ::: Baselines ::: Language model (LM):
For a peer summary, a reasonable estimate of $\mathcal {Q}1$ (Grammaticality) is the perplexity returned by a pre-trained language model. We experiment with the pre-trained GPT-2 model BIBREF22, and with the probability estimates that BERT can produce for each token when the token is treated as masked (BERT-FR-LM). Given that the grammaticality of a summary can be corrupted by just a few bad tokens, we compute the perplexity by considering only the $k$ worst (lowest LM probability) tokens of the peer summary, where $k$ is a tuned hyper-parameter.

Methods ::: Baselines ::: Next sentence prediction:
BERT training relies on two tasks: predicting masked tokens and next sentence prediction. The latter seems to be aligned with the definitions of $\mathcal {Q}3$ (Referential Clarity), $\mathcal {Q}4$ (Focus) and $\mathcal {Q}5$ (Structure & Coherence). Intuitively, when a sentence follows another with high probability, it should involve clear referential expressions and preserve the focus and local coherence of the text. We, therefore, use a pre-trained BERT model (BERT-FR-NS) to calculate the sentence-level perplexity of each summary:

where $p(s_i|s_{i-1})$ is the probability that BERT assigns to the sequence of sentences $\left< s_{i-1}, s \right>$, and $n$ is the number of sentences in the peer summary. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Learning Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Link Prediction, How better does HAKE model peform than state-of-the-art methods? [/INST] WN18RR dataset consists of two kinds of relations: the symmetric relations such as $\_similar\_to$, which link entities in the category (b); other relations such as $\_hypernym$ and $\_member\_meronym$, which link entities in the category (a). Actually, RotatE can model entities in the category (b) very well BIBREF7. However, HAKE gains a 0.021 higher MRR, a 2.4% higher H@1, and a 2.4% higher H@3 against RotatE, respectively.
FB15k-237 dataset has more complex relation types and fewer entities, compared with WN18RR and YAGO3-10. Although there are relations that reflect hierarchy in FB15k-237, there are also lots of relations, such as â€œ/location/location/time_zonesâ€ and â€œ/film/film/prequelâ€, that do not lead to hierarchy. The characteristic of this dataset accounts for why our proposed models doesn't outperform the previous state-of-the-art as much as that of WN18RR and YAGO3-10 datasets.
AGO3-10 datasets contains entities with high relation-specific indegree BIBREF18. For example, the link prediction task $(?, hasGender, male)$ has over 1000 true answers, which makes the task challenging. Fortunately, we can regard â€œmaleâ€ as an entity at higher level of the hierarchy and the predicted head entities as entities at lower level. In this way, YAGO3-10 is a dataset that clearly has semantic hierarchy property, and we can expect that our proposed models is capable of working well on this dataset. Table TABREF19 validates our expectation. Both ModE and HAKE significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art. Notably, HAKE gains a 0.050 higher MRR, 6.0% higher H@1 and 4.6% higher H@3 than RotatE, respectively. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: An Empirical Study, Which similarity datasets do they use? [/INST] As mentioned in subsec:datasets, all the word-similarity datasets contain pairs of words annotated with similarity or relatedness scores, although this difference is not always explicit. Below we provide some details for each.

MEN contains 3000 annotated word pairs with integer scores ranging from 0 to 50. Words correspond to image labels appearing in the ESP-Game and MIRFLICKR-1M image datasets.

MTurk287 contains 287 annotated pairs with scores ranging from 1.0 to 5.0. It was created from words appearing in both DBpedia and in news articles from The New York Times.

MTurk771 contains 771 annotated pairs with scores ranging from 1.0 to 5.0, with words having synonymy, holonymy or meronymy relationships sampled from WordNet BIBREF56 .

RG contains 65 annotated pairs with scores ranging from 0.0 to 4.0 representing â€œsimilarity of meaningâ€.

RW contains 2034 pairs of words annotated with similarity scores in a scale from 0 to 10. The words included in this dataset were obtained from Wikipedia based on their frequency, and later filtered depending on their WordNet synsets, including synonymy, hyperonymy, hyponymy, holonymy and meronymy. This dataset was created with the purpose of testing how well models can represent rare and complex words.

SimLex999 contains 999 word pairs annotated with similarity scores ranging from 0 to 10. In this case the authors explicitly considered similarity and not relatedness, addressing the shortcomings of datasets that do not, such as MEN and WS353. Words include nouns, adjectives and verbs.

SimVerb3500 contains 3500 verb pairs annotated with similarity scores ranging from 0 to 10. Verbs were obtained from the USF free association database BIBREF66 , and VerbNet BIBREF63 . This dataset was created to address the lack of representativity of verbs in SimLex999, and the fact that, at the time of creation, the best performing models had already surpassed inter-annotator agreement in verb similarity evaluation resources. Like SimLex999, this dataset also explicitly considers similarity as opposed to relatedness.

WS353 contains 353 word pairs annotated with similarity scores from 0 to 10.

WS353R is a subset of WS353 containing 252 word pairs annotated with relatedness scores. This dataset was created by asking humans to classify each WS353 word pair into one of the following classes: synonyms, antonyms, identical, hyperonym-hyponym, hyponym-hyperonym, holonym-meronym, meronym-holonym, and none-of-the-above. These annotations were later used to group the pairs into: similar pairs (synonyms, antonyms, identical, hyperonym-hyponym, and hyponym-hyperonym), related pairs (holonym-meronym, meronym-holonym, and none-of-the-above with a human similarity score greater than 5), and unrelated pairs (classified as none-of-the-above with a similarity score less than or equal to 5). This dataset is composed by the union of related and unrelated pairs.

WS353S is another subset of WS353 containing 203 word pairs annotated with similarity scores. This dataset is composed by the union of similar and unrelated pairs, as described previously. </s>

Benchmarks ::: Doc2Vec + SVM
We also used simple classification models with learned embeddings. We trained a Doc2Vec model BIBREF15 using the dataset and used the embedding document vectors as features for a linear SVM classifier.

Benchmarks ::: Hierarchical RNN
For this benchmark, we considered a Hierarchical RNN, following BIBREF16. We used two BiLSTMs BIBREF17 with 256 units each to model sentences and documents. The tokens of a sentence were processed independently of other sentence tokens. For each direction in the token-level BiLSTM, the last outputs were concatenated and fed into the sentence-level BiLSTM as inputs.

The outputs of the BiLSTM were connected to 2 dense layers with 256 ReLU units and a Softmax layer. We initialized tokens with publicly available embeddings trained with GloVe BIBREF18. Sentence boundaries were provided by SpaCy. Dropout was applied to the dense hidden layers during training.

Benchmarks ::: Bi-directional RNN and Self-Attention (BiRNN + Self-Attention)
One challenge with RNN-based solutions for text classification is finding the best way to combine word-level representations into higher-level representations.

Self-attention BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21 has been adapted to text classification, providing improved interpretability and performance. We used BIBREF20 as the basis of this benchmark.

The benchmark used a layered Bi-directional RNN (60 units) with GRU cells and a dense layer. Both self-attention layers were 60 units in size and cross-entropy was used as the cost function.

Note that we have omitted the orthogonal regularizer term, since this dataset is relatively small compared to the traditional datasets used for training such a model. We did not observe any significant performance gain while using the regularizer term in our experiments.

Benchmarks ::: ELMo embedding and Bi-directional RNN (ELMo + BiRNN)
Deep Contextualized Word Representations (ELMo) BIBREF22 have shown recent success in a number of NLP tasks. The unsupervised nature of the language model allows it to utilize a large amount of available unlabelled data in order to learn better representations of words.

We used the pre-trained ELMo model (v2) available on Tensorhub for this benchmark. We fed the word embeddings of ELMo as input into a one layer Bi-directional RNN (16 units) with GRU cells (with dropout) and a dense layer. Cross-entropy was used as the cost function.

Benchmarks ::: Fine-tuned BERT
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) BIBREF11 has achieved state-of-the-art results on several NLP tasks, including sentence classification.

The possible genders are `masculine', `feminine' and `both', where the latter indicates a case where the none-diacriticized written form admits both a masculine and a feminine reading. We expect the gender to match the ones requested in the prefix.

Interlocutors' Gender and Number Effects: We search for second-person pronouns and consider their gender and number. For pronouns in subject position, we also consider the gender and number of their governing verbs (or adjectives in copular constructions). For a singular audience, we expect the gender and number to match the requested ones. For a plural audience, we expect the masculine-plural forms. </s>

We see that the baseline system severely under-predicts the feminine form of verbs as compared to the reference. The â€œHe saidâ€ conditions further decreases the number of feminine verbs, while the â€œI saidâ€ conditions bring it back to the baseline level. Finally, the â€œShe saidâ€ prefixes substantially increase the number of feminine-marked verbs, bringing the proportion much closer to that of the reference (though still under-predicting some of the feminine cases). </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Filling Gender&Number Gaps in Neural Machine Translation with Black-box Context Injection, What are the components of the black-box context injection system? [/INST] Our goal is to supply an NMT system with knowledge regarding the speaker and interlocutor of first-person sentences, in order to produce the desired target-side morphology when the information is not available in the source sentence. The approach we take in the current work is that of black-box injection, in which we attempt to inject knowledge to the input in order to influence the output of a trained NMT system, without having access to its internals or its training procedure as proposed by vanmassenhove-hardmeier-way:2018:EMNLP.
To verify this, we experiment with translating the sentences with the following variations: No Prefixâ€”The baseline translation as returned by the GMT system. â€œHe said:â€â€”Signaling a male speaker. We expect to further skew the system towards masculine forms. â€œShe said:â€â€”Signaling a female speaker and unknown audience. As this matches the actual speaker's gender, we expect an improvement in translation of first-person pronouns and verbs with first-person pronouns as subjects. â€œI said to them:â€â€”Signaling an unknown speaker and plural audience. â€œHe said to them:â€â€”Masculine speaker and plural audience. â€œShe said to them:â€â€”Female speaker and plural audienceâ€”the complete, correct condition.

[/INST] No. Following BIBREF7, we then evaluated a metric that combines intent and entities, computed by simply summing up the two confusion matrices (Table TABREF23). Results highlight the contribution of the entity tagging task, where HERMIT outperforms the other approaches. Paired-samples t-tests were conducted to compare the HERMIT combined F1 against the other systems.Together with the evaluation metrics used in BIBREF7, we report the span F1, computed using the CoNLL-2000 shared task evaluation script, and the Exact Match (EM) accuracy of the entire sequence of labels. It is worth noticing that the EM Combined score is computed as the conjunction of the three individual predictions â€“ e.g., a match is when all the three sequences are correct.
We also report the metrics in BIBREF7 for consistency. For dialogue act and frame tasks, scores provide just the extent to which the network is able to detect those labels. In fact, the metrics do not consider any span information, essential to solve and evaluate our tasks. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Interactive Machine Comprehension with Information Seeking Agents, Do they provide decision sequences as supervision while training models? [/INST] The key idea behind our proposed interactive MRC (iMRC) is to restrict the document context that a model observes at one time. Concretely, we split a supporting document into its component sentences and withhold these sentences from the model. Given a question, the model must issue commands to observe sentences in the withheld set; we equip models with actions such as Ctrl+F (search for token) and stop for searching through partially observed documents. A model searches iteratively, conditioning each command on the input question and the sentences it has observed previously. Thus, our task requires models to `feed themselves' rather than spoon-feeding them with information.

iMRC: Making MRC Interactive ::: Evaluation Metric
Since iMRC involves both MRC and RL, we adopt evaluation metrics from both settings. First, as a question answering task, we use $\text{F}_1$ score to compare predicted answers against ground-truth, as in previous works. When there exist multiple ground-truth answers, we report the max $\text{F}_1$ score. Second, mastering multiple games remains quite challenging for RL agents. Therefore, we evaluate an agent's performance during both its training and testing phases. During training, we report training curves averaged over 3 random seeds. During test, we follow common practice in supervised learning tasks where we report the agent's test performance corresponding to its best validation performance . </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Bringing Stories Alive: Generating Interactive Fiction Worlds, How well did the system do? [/INST] No. We conducted two sets of human participant evaluations by recruiting participants over Amazon Mechanical Turk. The first evaluation tests the knowledge graph construction phase, in which we measure perceived coherence and genre or theme resemblance of graphs extracted by different models. The second study compares full gamesâ€”including description generation and game assembly, which can't easily be isolated from graph constructionâ€”generated by different methods. This study looks at how interesting the games were to the players in addition to overall coherence and genre resemblance. Both studies are performed across two genres: mystery and fairy-tales.
Each participant was was asked to play the neural game and then another one from one of the three additional models within a genre. The completion criteria for each game is collect half the total score possible in the game, i.e. explore half of all possible rooms and examine half of all possible entities. This provided the participant with multiple possible methods of finishing a particular game. On completion, the participant was asked to rank the two games according to overall perceived coherence, interestingness, and adherence to the genre. We additionally provided a required initial tutorial game which demonstrated all of these mechanics. The order in which participants played the games was also randomized as in the graph evaluation to remove potential correlations. We had 75 participants in total, 39 for mystery and 36 for fairy-tales. As each player played the neural model created game and one from each of the other approachesâ€”this gave us 13 on average for the other approaches in the mystery genre and 12 for fairy-tale Indicates statistical significance (p < 0.05).
In the mystery genre, the neural approach is generally preferred by a greater percentage of participants than the rules or random. The human-made game outperforms them all. A significant exception to is that participants thought that the rules-based game was more interesting than the neural game. The trends in the fairy-tale genre are in general similar with a few notable deviations. The first deviation is that the rules-based and random approaches perform significantly worse than neural in this genre. We see also that the neural game is as coherent as the human-made game. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Bringing Stories Alive: Generating Interactive Fiction Worlds, How is the information extracted? [/INST] The first phase is to extract a knowledge graph from the story that depicts locations, characters, objects, and the relations between these entities. We present two techniques. The first uses neural question-answering technique to extract relations from a story text. The second, provided as a baseline, uses OpenIE5, a commonly used rule-based information extraction technique. For the sake of simplicity, we considered primarily the location-location and location-character/object relations, represented by the â€œnext toâ€ and â€œhasâ€ edges respectively in Figure FIGREF4.
We instead propose a new method that leverages models trained for context-grounded question-answering tasks to do entity extraction with no task dependent data or fine-tuning necessary. Our method, dubbed AskBERT, leverages the Question-Answering (QA) model ALBERT BIBREF15. AskBERT consists of two main steps as shown in Figure FIGREF7: vertex extraction and graph construction.
The first step is to extract the set of entitiesâ€”graph verticesâ€”from the story. We are looking to extract information specifically regarding characters, locations, and objects. This is done by using asking the QA model questions such as â€œWho is a character in the story?â€. BIBREF16 have shown that the phrasing of questions given to a QA model is important and this forms the basis of how we formulate our questionsâ€”questions are asked so that they are more likely to return a single answer, e.g. asking â€œWhere is a location in the story?â€ as opposed to â€œWhere are the locations in the story?â€. In particular, we notice that pronoun choice can be crucial; â€œWhere is a location in the story?â€ yielded more consistent extraction than â€œWhat is a location in the story?â€. ALBERT QA is trained to also output a special <$no$-$answer$> token when it cannot find an answer to the question within the story. Our method makes use of this by iteratively asking QA model a question and masking out the most likely answer outputted on the previous step. This process continues until the <$no$-$answer$> token becomes the most likely answer.

The next step is graph construction. Typical interactive fiction worlds are usually structured as trees, i.e. no cycles except between locations. Using this fact, we use an approach that builds a graph from the vertex set by one relationâ€”or edgeâ€”at a time. Once again using the entire story plot as context, we query the ALBERT-QA model picking a random starting location $x$ from the set of vertices previously extracted.and asking the questions â€œWhat location can I visit from $x$?â€ and â€œWho/What is in $x$?â€. The methodology for phrasing these questions follows that described for the vertex extraction. The answer given by the QA model is matched to the vertex set by picking the vertex $u$ that contains the best word-token overlap with the answer. Relations between vertices are added by computing a relation probability on the basis of the output probabilities of the answer given by the QA model.
We compared our proposed AskBERT method with a non-neural, rule-based approach. This approach is based on the information extracted by OpenIE5, followed by some post-processing such as named-entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. OpenIE5 combines several cutting-edge ideas from several existing papers BIBREF17, BIBREF18, BIBREF19 to create a powerful information extraction tools. For a given sentence, OpenIE5 generates multiple triples in the format of $\langle entity, relation, entity\rangle $ as concise representations of the sentence, each with a confidence score. These triples are also occasionally annotated with location information indicating that a triple happened in a location.

As in the neural AskBERT model, we attempt to extract information regarding locations, characters, and objects. The entire story plot is passed into the OpenIE5 and we receive a set of triples. The location annotations on the triples are used to create a set of locations. We mark which sentences in the story contain these locations. POS tagging based on marking noun-phrases is then used in conjunction with NER to further filter the set of triplesâ€”identifying the set of characters and objects in the story.

The graph is constructed by linking the set of triples on the basis of the location they belong to. While some sentences contain very explicit location information for OpenIE5 to mark it out in the triples, most of them do not. We therefore make the assumption that the location remains the same for all triples extracted in between sentences where locations are explicitly mentioned. For example, if there exists $location A$ in the 1st sentence and $location B$ in the 5th sentence of the story, all the events described in sentences 1-4 are considered to take place in $location A$. The entities mentioned in these events are connected to $location A$ in the graph. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Enriching Existing Conversational Emotion Datasets with Dialogue Acts using Neural Annotators., How does the ensemble annotator extract the final label? [/INST] First preference is given to the labels that are perfectly matching in all the neural annotators. In Table TABREF11, we can see that both datasets have about 40% of exactly matching labels over all models (AM). Then priority is given to the context-based models to check if the label in all context models is matching perfectly. In case two out of three context models are correct, then it is being checked if that label is also produced by at least one of the non-context models. Then, we allow labels to rely on these at least two context models. As a result, about 47% of the labels are taken based on the context models (CM). When we see that none of the context models is producing the same results, then we rank the labels with their respective confidence values produced as a probability distribution using the $softmax$ function. The labels are sorted in descending order according to confidence values. Then we check if the first three (case when one context model and both non-context models produce the same label) or at least two labels are matching, then we allow to pick that one. There are about 3% in IEMOCAP and 5% in MELD (BM).

Finally, when none the above conditions are fulfilled, we leave out the label with an unknown category. This unknown category of the dialogue act is labeled with `xx' in the final annotations, and they are about 7% in IEMOCAP and 11% in MELD (NM). </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Emotion helps Sentiment: A Multi-task Model for Sentiment and Emotion Analysis, How is multi-tasking performed? [/INST] The proposed system consists of a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) BIBREF16, a two-level attention mechanism BIBREF29, BIBREF30 and a shared representation for emotion and sentiment analysis tasks. The BiLSTM encodes the word representation of each word. This representation is shared between the subsystems of sentiment and emotion analysis. Each of the shared representations is then fed to the primary attention mechanism of both the subsystems. The primary attention mechanism finds the best representation for each word for each task. The secondary attention mechanism acts on top of the primary attention to extract the best sentence representation by focusing on the suitable context for each task. Finally, the representations of both the tasks are fed to two different feed-forward neural networks to produce two outputs - one for sentiment analysis and one for emotion analysis. Each component is explained in the subsequent subsections. </s>

To examine the utility of our features in a neural framework, we further adapt our word-level task as a tagging task, and use LSTM as a baseline. Specifically, we concatenate an OP and PC with a special token as the separator so that an LSTM model can potentially distinguish the OP from PC, and then tag each word based on the label of its stemmed version.

[itemsep=0pt,leftmargin=*,topsep=0pt]

Non-contextual properties of a word. These features are derived directly from the word and capture the general tendency of a word being echoed in explanations.

Word usage in an OP or PC (two groups). These features capture how a word is used in an OP or PC. As a result, for each feature, we have two values for the OP and PC respectively.

How a word connects an OP and PC. These features look at the difference between word usage in the OP and PC. We expect this group to be the most important in our task.

Overall performance (Figure FIGREF28). Although our word-level task is heavily imbalanced, all of our models outperform the random baseline by a wide margin. As expected, content words are much more difficult to predict than stopwords, but the best F1 score in content words more than doubles that of the random baseline (0.286 vs. 0.116). Notably, although we strongly improve on our random baseline, even our best F1 scores are relatively low, and this holds true regardless of the model used.

It follows that we are only able to derive a limited understanding of how people choose to echo words in explanations. The extent to which explanation construction is fundamentally random BIBREF47, or whether there exist other unidentified patterns, is of course an open question.

THA and STN are built on two LSTMs that generate the initial word representations for the primary ATE task and the auxiliary opinion detection task respectively. THA is designed to integrate the information of aspect detection history into the current aspect feature to generate a new history-aware aspect representation. STN first calculates a new opinion representation conditioned on the current aspect candidate. Then, we employ a bi-linear attention network to calculate the opinion summary as the weighted sum of the new opinion representations, according to their associations with the current aspect representation. Finally, the history-aware aspect representation and the opinion summary are concatenated as features for aspect prediction of the current time step. </s>

The results show that each of THA and STN is helpful for improving the performance, and the contribution of STN is slightly larger than THA. â€œOURS w/o THA & STNâ€ only keeps the basic bi-linear attention. Although it performs not bad, it is still less competitive compared with the strongest baseline (i.e., CMLA), suggesting that only using attention mechanism to distill opinion summary is not enough. After inserting the STN component before the bi-linear attention, i.e. â€œOURS w/o THAâ€, we get about 1% absolute gains on each dataset, and then the performance is comparable to CMLA.

<s>[INST] In the paper Uncover Sexual Harassment Patterns from Personal Stories by Joint Key Element Extraction and Categorization, What patterns were discovered from the stories? [/INST] We plotted the distribution of harassment incidents in each categorization dimension (Figure FIGREF19). It displays statistics that provide important evidence as to the scale of harassment and that can serve as the basis for more effective interventions to be developed by authorities ranging from advocacy organizations to policy makers. It provides evidence to support some commonly assumed factors about harassment: First, we demonstrate that harassment occurred more frequently during the night time than the day time. Second, it shows that besides unspecified strangers (not shown in the figure), conductors and drivers are top the list of identified types of harassers, followed by friends and relatives.
Furthermore, we uncovered that there exist strong correlations between the age of perpetrators and the location of harassment, between the single/multiple harasser(s) and location, and between age and single/multiple harasser(s) (Figure FIGREF20). 
We also found that the majority of young perpetrators engaged in harassment behaviors on the streets. These findings suggest that interventions with young men and boys, who are readily influenced by peers, might be most effective when education is done peer-to-peer. It also points to the locations where such efforts could be made, including both in schools and on the streets. 
In contrast, we found that adult perpetrators of sexual harassment are more likely to act alone. Most of the adult harassers engaged in harassment on public transportation. These differences in adult harassment activities and locations, mean that interventions should be responsive to these factors. For example, increasing the security measures on transit at key times and locations.
In addition, we also found that the correlations between the forms of harassment with the age, single/multiple harasser, type of harasser, and location (Figure FIGREF21). For example, young harassers are more likely to engage in behaviors of verbal harassment, rather than physical harassment as compared to adults. It was a single perpetrator that engaged in touching or groping more often, rather than groups of perpetrators.
In contrast, commenting happened more frequently when harassers were in groups. Last but not least, public transportation is where people got indecently touched most frequently both by fellow passengers and by conductors and drivers. The nature and location of the harassment are particularly significant in developing strategies for those who are harassed or who witness the harassment to respond and manage the everyday threat of harassment. For example, some strategies will work best on public transport, a particular closed, shared space setting, while other strategies might be more effective on the open space of the street. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Gibberish Semantics: How Good is Russian Twitter in Word Semantic Similarity Task?, Which Twitter corpus was used to train the word vectors? [/INST] Twitter provides well-documented API, which allows to request any information about Tweets, users and their profiles, with respect to rate limits. There is special type of API, called Streaming API, that provides a real-time stream of tweets. The key difference with regular API is that connection is kept alive as long as possible, and Tweets are sent in real-time to the client. There are three endpoints of Streaming API of our interest: â€œsampleâ€, â€œfilterâ€ and â€œfirehoseâ€. The first one provides a sample (random subset) of the full Tweet stream. The second one allows to receive Tweets matching some search criteria: matching to one or more search keywords, produced by subset of users, or coming from certain geo location. The last one provides the full set of Tweets, although it is not available by default. In order to get Twitter â€œfirehoseâ€ one can contact Twitter, or buy this stream from third-parties.

In our case the simplest approach would be to use â€œsampleâ€ endpoint, but it provides Tweets in all possible languages from all over the World, while we are concerned only about one language (Russian). In order to use this endpoint we implemented filtering based on language. The filter is simple: if Tweet does not contain a substring of 3 or more cyrillic symbols, it is considered non-Russian. Although this approach keeps Tweets in Mongolian, Ukrainian and other slavic languages (because they use cyrillic alphabet), the total amount of false-positives in this case is negligible. To demonstrate this we conducted simple experiment: on a random sample of 200 tweets only 5 were in a language different from Russian. In order not to rely on Twitter language detection, we chose to proceed with this method of language-based filtering.

However, the amount of Tweets received through â€œsampleâ€ endpoint was not satisfying. This is probably because â€œsampleâ€ endpoint always streams the same content to all its clients, and small portion of it comes in Russian language. In order to force mining of Tweets in Russian language, we chose "filter" endpoint, which requires some search query. We constructed heuristic query, containing some auxiliary words, specific to Russian language: conjunctions, pronouns, prepositions. The full list is as follows:

russian Ñ, Ñƒ, Ðº, Ð², Ð¿Ð¾, Ð½Ð°, Ñ‚Ñ‹, Ð¼Ñ‹, Ð´Ð¾, Ð½Ð°, Ð¾Ð½Ð°, Ð¾Ð½, Ð¸, Ð´Ð°. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Team Papelo: Transformer Networks at FEVER, What is the FEVER task? [/INST] The release of the FEVER fact extraction and verification dataset BIBREF0 provides a large-scale challenge that tests a combination of retrieval and textual entailment capabilities. To verify a claim in the dataset as supported, refuted, or undecided, a system must retrieve relevant articles and sentences from Wikipedia. Then it must decide whether each of those sentences, or some combination of them, entails or refutes the claim, which is an entailment problem. Systems are evaluated on the accuracy of the claim predictions, with credit only given when correct evidence is submitted.
As entailment data, premises in FEVER data differ substantially from those in the image caption data used as the basis for the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) BIBREF1 dataset. Sentences are longer (31 compared to 14 words on average), vocabulary is more abstract, and the prevalence of named entities and out-of-vocabulary terms is higher.
The retrieval aspect of FEVER is not straightforward either. A claim may have small word overlap with the relevant evidence, especially if the claim is refuted by the evidence. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Controlling the Output Length of Neural Machine Translation, How do they enrich the positional embedding with length information [/INST] Methods ::: Length Encoding Method
Inspired by BIBREF11, we use length encoding to provide the network with information about the remaining sentence length during decoding. We propose two types of length encoding: absolute and relative. Let pos and len be, respectively, a token position and the end of the sequence, both expressed in terms of number characters. Then, the absolute approach encodes the remaining length:

where $i=1,\ldots ,d/2$.

Similarly, the relative difference encodes the relative position to the end. This representation is made consistent with the absolute encoding by quantizing the space of the relative positions into a finite set of $N$ integers:

where $q_N: [0, 1] \rightarrow \lbrace 0, 1, .., N\rbrace $ is simply defined as $q_N(x) = \lfloor {x \times N}\rfloor $. As we are interested in the character length of the target sequence, len and pos are given in terms of characters, but we represent the sequence as a sequence of BPE-segmented subwords BIBREF17. To solve the ambiguity, len is the character length of the sequence, while pos is the character count of all the preceding tokens. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Controlling the Output Length of Neural Machine Translation, How do they condition the output to a given target-source class? [/INST] Methods ::: Length Token Method
Our first approach to control the length is inspired by target forcing in multilingual NMT BIBREF15, BIBREF16. We first split the training sentence pairs into three groups according to the target/source length ratio (in terms of characters). Ideally, we want a group where the target is shorter than the source (short), one where they are equally-sized (normal) and a last group where the target is longer than the source (long). In practice, we select two thresholds $t_\text{min}$ and $t_\text{max}$ according to the length ratio distribution. All the sentence pairs with length ratio between $t_\text{min}$ and $t_\text{max}$ are in the normal group, the ones with ratio below $t_\text{min}$ in short and the remaining in long. At training time we prepend a length token to each source sentence according to its group ($<$short$>$, $<$normal$>$, or $<$long$>$), in order to let a single network to discriminate between the groups (see Figure FIGREF2). At inference time, the length token is used to bias the network to generate a translation that belongs to the desired length group. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Controlling the Output Length of Neural Machine Translation, Which languages do they focus on?

<s>[INST] In the paper Controlling the Output Length of Neural Machine Translation, Do they experiment with combining both methods? [/INST] Methods ::: Combining the two methods
We further propose to use the two methods together to combine their strengths. In fact, while the length token acts as a soft constraint to bias NMT to produce short or long translation with respect to the source, actually no length information is given to the network. On the other side, length encoding leverages information about the target length, but it is agnostic of the source length. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Torch-Struct: Deep Structured Prediction Library, What baselines are used in experiments? [/INST] Parallel Scan Inference
The commutative properties of semiring algorithms allow flexibility in the order in which we compute $A(\ell )$. Typical implementations of dynamic programming algorithms are serial in the length of the sequence.
Vectorized Parsing
Computational complexity is even more of an issue for parsing algorithms, which cannot be as easily parallelized.
Semiring Matrix Operations
The two previous optimizations reduce most of the cost to semiring matrix multiplication. In the specific case of the $(\sum , \times )$ semiring these can be computed very efficiently using matrix multiplication, which is highly-tuned on GPU hardware. Unfortunately for other semirings, such as log and max, these operations are either slow or very memory inefficient. For instance, for matrices $T$ and $U$ of sized $N \times M$ and $M \times O$, we can broadcast with $\otimes $ to a tensor of size $N \times M \times O$ and then reduce dim $M$ by $\bigoplus $ at a huge memory cost. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper CRWIZ: A Framework for Crowdsourcing Real-Time Wizard-of-Oz Dialogues, What is meant by semiguided dialogue, what part of dialogue is guided? [/INST] By providing the Wizard with several dialogue options (aside from free text), we guided the conversation and could introduce actions that change an internal system state. This proposes several advantages:

A guided dialogue allows for set procedures to be learned and reduces the amount of data needed for a machine learning model for dialogue management to converge.

Providing several dialogue options to the Wizard increases the pace of the interaction and allows them to understand and navigate more complex scenarios.

A graph of dialogue states, transitions and utterances is loaded when the system is initialised, and each chat room has its own dialogue state, which changes through actions.
In addition to the transitions that the FSM provides, there are other fixed dialogue options always available such as â€œHold on, 2 secondsâ€, â€œOkayâ€ or â€œSorry, can you repeat that?â€ as a shortcut for commonly used dialogue acts, as well as the option to type a message freely.
The dialogue has several paths to reach the same states with varying levels of Operator control or engagement that enriched the heterogeneity of conversations. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper CRWIZ: A Framework for Crowdsourcing Real-Time Wizard-of-Oz Dialogues, Is CRWIZ already used for data collection, what are the results? [/INST] For the intitial data collection using the CRWIZ platform, 145 unique dialogues were collected (each dialogue consists of a conversation between two participants). 
The average time per assignment was 10 minutes 47 seconds, very close to our initial estimate of 10 minutes, and the task was available for 5 days in AMT. Out of the 145 dialogues, 14 (9.66%) obtained the bonus of $0.2 for resolving the emergency. We predicted that only a small portion of the participants would be able to resolve the emergency in less than 6 minutes, thus it was framed as a bonus challenge rather than a requirement to get paid. The fastest time recorded to resolve the emergency was 4 minutes 13 seconds with a mean of 5 minutes 8 seconds. Table TABREF28 shows several interaction statistics for the data collected compared to the single lab-based WoZ study BIBREF4.

Data Analysis ::: Subjective Data
Table TABREF33 gives the results from the post-task survey. We observe, that subjective and objective task success are similar in that the dialogues that resolved the emergency were rated consistently higher than the rest.

Mann-Whitney-U one-tailed tests show that the scores of the Emergency Resolved Dialogues for Q1 and Q2 were significantly higher than the scores of the Emergency Not Resolved Dialogues at the 95% confidence level (Q1: $U = 1654.5$, $p < 0.0001$; Q2: $U = 2195$, $p = 0.009$, both $p < 0.05$). This indicates that effective collaboration and information ease are key to task completion in this setting.

Regarding the qualitative data, one of the objectives of the Wizard-of-Oz technique was to make the participant believe that they are interacting with an automated agent and the qualitative feedback seemed to reflect this: â€œThe AI in the game was not helpful at all [...]â€ or â€œI was talking to Fred a bot assistant, I had no other partner in the gameâ€œ.

Data Analysis ::: Single vs Multiple Wizards
In Table TABREF28, we compare various metrics from the dialogues collected with crowdsourcing with the dialogues previously collected in a lab environment for a similar task. Most figures are comparable, except the number of emergency assistant turns (and consequently the total number of turns). To further understand these differences, we have first grouped the dialogue acts in four different broader types: Updates, Actions, Interactions and Requests, and computed the relative frequency of each of these types in both data collections. In addition, Figures FIGREF29 and FIGREF30 show the distribution of the most frequent dialogue acts in the different settings. It is visible that in the lab setting where the interaction was face-to-face with a robot, the Wizard used more Interaction dialogue acts (Table TABREF32). These were often used in context where the Wizard needed to hold the turn while looking for the appropriate prompt or waiting for the robot to arrive at the specified goal in the environment. On the other hand, in the crowdsourced data collection utterances, the situation updates were a more common choice while the assistant was waiting for the robot to travel to the specified goal in the environment.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the data shows a medium strong positive correlation between task success and the number of Action type dialogue acts the Wizard performs, triggering events in the world leading to success ($R=0.475$). There is also a positive correlation between task success and the number of Request dialogue acts requesting confirmation before actions ($R=0.421$), e.g., â€œWhich robot do you want to send?â€. As Table 3 shows, these are relatively rare but perhaps reflect a level of collaboration needed to further the task to completion. Table TABREF40 shows one of the dialogues collected where the Emergency Assistant continuously engaged with the Operator through these types of dialogue acts.

The task success rate was also very different between the two set-ups. In experiments reported in BIBREF4, 96% of the dialogues led to the extinction of the fire whereas in the crowdsourcing setting only 9.66% achieved the same goal. In the crowdsourced setting, the robots were slower moving at realistic speeds unlike the lab setting. A higher bonus and more time for the task might lead to a higher task success rate.

Data Analysis ::: Limitations
It is important to consider the number of available participants ready and willing to perform the task at any one time. This type of crowdsourcing requires two participants to connect within a few minutes of each other to be partnered together. As mentioned above, there were some issues with participants not collaborating and these dialogues had to be discarded as they were not of use. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper CRWIZ: A Framework for Crowdsourcing Real-Time Wizard-of-Oz Dialogues, How does framework made sure that dialogue will not breach procedures? [/INST] Wizard interface: the interface shown to participants with the Wizard role provides possible actions on the right-hand side of the browser window. These actions could be verbal, such as sending a message, or non-verbal, such as switching on/off a button to activate a robot. 
Dialogue structure: we introduced structured dialogues through a Finite State Machine (FSM) that controls the current dialogue state and offers multiple suitable and relevant state transitions (actions) to the Wizard depending on the point in the interaction, the state of the world and the history. A graph of dialogue states, transitions and utterances is loaded when the system is initialised, and each chat room has its own dialogue state, which changes through actions.
System-changing actions: actions trigger transitions between the states in the FSM. We differentiate two types of actions:

Verbal actions, such as the dialogue options available at that moment. The Wizard can select one of several predefined messages to send, or type their own message if needed. Free text messages do not change the dialogue state in the FSM, so it is important to minimise their use by providing enough dialogue options to the Wizard. Predefined messages can also trigger other associated events such as pop-ups or follow-up non-verbal actions.

Non-verbal actions, such as commands to trigger events. These can take any form, but we used buttons to control robots in our data collection.

Submitting an action would change the dialogue state in the FSM, altering the set of actions available in the subsequent turn visible to the Wizard. Some dialogue options are only possible at certain states, in a similar way as to how non-verbal actions are enabled or disabled depending on the state.  </s>

Apart from these classic metrics, we also include a novel embedding-based metric named BERTScore BIBREF32.

However, they are created under specific contexts (i.e. an image or a video) and thus might be less representative for common sense. To better measure the quality and interpretability of generative reasoners, we need to evaluate them with scenes and rationales created by using concept-sets only as the signals for annotators.

This paper describes some of the lessons we learned building SlugBot for the 2017 Alexa Prize, particularly focusing on the challenges of integrating content found via search with content from structured data in order to carry on an ongoing, coherent, open-domain, mixed-initiative conversation
More challenging is that at each system turn, there are a large number of conversational moves that are possible.
 Finally, most other domains do not have such high quality structured data available, leaving us to develop or try to rely on more general models of discourse coherence.

<s>[INST] In the paper Identifying and Understanding User Reactions to Deceptive and Trusted Social News Sources, How is speed measured? [/INST] The first metric we report is the reaction type.

Our second goal is to determine if these trends are maintained for various types of news sources on Twitter and Reddit.
To examine whether users react to content from trusted sources differently than from deceptive sources, we measure the reaction delay, which we define as the time elapsed between the moment the link or content was posted/tweeted and the moment that the reaction comment or tweet occurred. We report the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for each source type and use Mann Whitney U (MWU) tests to compare whether users respond with a given reaction type with significantly different delays to news sources of different levels of credibility. </s>

Non-cursing aggressions and insults This is a challenging problem, since the majority of abusive and insulting comments rely on profanity and swearing.

Errors on Disclosure (D) prediction: A major source of error that affects disclosure is the shallow meaning representation obtained from the BOW model even when augmented with the distributional features given by the glove vectors.
Errors on Interpretation (R) prediction: it is a common practice from many users to directly ask the suspected troll if he/she is trolling or not. 
Errors on Response Strategy (B) prediction: In some cases there is a blurry line between â€œFrustrateâ€ and â€œNeutralizeâ€.

<s>[INST] In the paper On Leveraging the Visual Modality for Neural Machine Translation, What is result of their Principal Component Analysis? [/INST] In other words, there exist a few directions in the embedding space which disproportionately explain the variance.
It is clear that the visual features in the case of How2 dataset are much more dominated by the "common" dimensions, when compared to the Multi30k dataset. Further, this analysis is still at the sentence level, i.e. the visual features are much less discriminative among individual sentences, further aggravating the problem at the token level. This suggests that the existing visual features aren't sufficient enough to expect benefits from the visual modality in NMT, since they won't provide discriminativeness among the vocabulary elements at the token level during prediction. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper On Leveraging the Visual Modality for Neural Machine Translation, What are 3 novel fusion techniques that are proposed? [/INST] Proposed Fusion Techniques ::: Step-Wise Decoder Fusion
Our first proposed technique is the step-wise decoder fusion of visual features during every prediction step i.e. we concatenate the visual encoding as context at each step of the decoding process.
Proposed Fusion Techniques ::: Multimodal Attention Modulation
Similar to general attention BIBREF8, wherein a variable-length alignment vector $a_{th}(s)$, whose size equals the number of time steps on the source side, is derived by comparing the current target hidden state $h_{t}$ with each source hidden state $\overline{h_{s}}$; we consider a variant wherein the visual encoding $v_{t}$ is used to calculate an attention distribution $a_{tv}(s)$ over the source encodings as well.

The key component of our framework is the Ranker model, which is provided with a question $q$ and $K$ passages $\mathcal {P} = \lbrace p_1, p_2 ... p_K\rbrace $ from a pool of candidates, and outputs a chain of selected passages.
Method ::: Cooperative Reasoner
To alleviate the noise in the distant supervision signal $\mathcal {C}$, in addition to the conditional selection, we further propose a cooperative Reasoner model, also implemented with the MatchLSTM architecture (see Appendix SECREF6), to predict the linking entity from the selected passages. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Learning to Recover Reasoning Chains for Multi-Hop Question Answering via Cooperative Games, How do two models cooperate to select the most confident chains? [/INST] Intuitively, when the Ranker makes more accurate passage selections, the Reasoner will work with less noisy data and thus is easier to succeed. Specifically, the Reasoner learns to extract the linking entity from chains selected by a well-trained Ranker, and it benefits the Ranker training by providing extra rewards. </s>

In this study, we address three aspects that we consider to be particularly relevant for human evaluation of MT, with a special focus on testing humanâ€“machine parity: the choice of raters, the use of linguistic context, and the construction of reference translations.
We empirically test and discuss the impact of these factors on human evaluation of MT in Sections SECREF3â€“SECREF5.  </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper A Set of Recommendations for Assessing Human-Machine Parity in Language Translation, What recommendations do they offer? [/INST]  In this section, we recommend a set of evaluation design changes that we believe are needed for assessing humanâ€“machine parity, and will strengthen the human evaluation of MT in general.

Recommendations ::: (R1) Choose professional translators as raters.
In our blind experiment (Section SECREF3), non-experts assess parity between human and machine translation where professional translators do not, indicating that the former neglect more subtle differences between different translation outputs.

Recommendations ::: (R2) Evaluate documents, not sentences.
When evaluating sentences in random order, professional translators judge machine translation more favourably as they cannot identify errors related to textual coherence and cohesion, such as different translations of the same product name. Our experiments show that using whole documents (i. e., full news articles) as unit of evaluation increases the rating gap between human and machine translation (Section SECREF4).

Recommendations ::: (R3) Evaluate fluency in addition to adequacy.
Raters who judge target language fluency without access to the source texts show a stronger preference for human translation than raters with access to the source texts (Sections SECREF4 and SECREF24). In all of our experiments, raters prefer human translation in terms of fluency while, just as in BIBREF3's BIBREF3 evaluation, they find no significant difference between human and machine translation in sentence-level adequacy (Tables TABREF21 and TABREF30). Our error analysis in Table TABREF34 also indicates that MT still lags behind human translation in fluency, specifically in grammaticality.

Recommendations ::: (R4) Do not heavily edit reference translations for fluency.
In professional translation workflows, texts are typically revised with a focus on target language fluency after an initial translation step. As shown in our experiment in Section SECREF24, aggressive revision can make translations more fluent but less accurate, to the degree that they become indistinguishable from MT in terms of accuracy (Table TABREF30).

Recommendations ::: (R5) Use original source texts.
Raters show a significant preference for human over machine translations of texts that were originally written in the source language, but not for source texts that are translations themselves (Section SECREF35). Our results are further evidence that translated texts tend to be simpler than original texts, and in turn easier to translate with MT. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper A Set of Recommendations for Assessing Human-Machine Parity in Language Translation, What percentage fewer errors did professional translations make? [/INST] 36%. Errors represent the number of sentences (out of N = 150) that contain at least one error of the respective type. We also report the number of sentences that contain at least one error of any category (Any), and the total number of error categories present in all sentences (Total). Statistical significance is assessed with Fisherâ€™s exact test (two-tailed) for each pair of translation outputs.
To achieve a finer-grained understanding of what errors the evaluated translations exhibit, we perform a categorisation of 150 randomly sampled sentences based on the classification used by BIBREF3
 The analysis was performed on one machine translation (MT$_1$) and two human translation outputs (H$_A$, H$_B$), using the same 150 sentences, but blinding their origin by randomising the order in which the documents were presented. We show the results of this analysis in Table TABREF32. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper A Set of Recommendations for Assessing Human-Machine Parity in Language Translation, What was the weakness in Hassan et al's evaluation design? [/INST]  BIBREF3 also use bilingual crowd workers, but the studies supporting the use of crowdsourcing for MT evaluation were performed with older MT systems, and their findings may not carry over to the evaluation of contemporary higher-quality neural machine translation (NMT) systems. In addition, the MT developers to which crowd workers were compared are usually not professional translators. 
We hypothesise that an evaluation of sentences in isolation, as applied by BIBREF3, precludes raters from detecting translation errors that become apparent only when inter-sentential context is available, and that they will judge MT quality less favourably when evaluating full documents.
BIBREF3 used all source texts of the WMT 2017 Chineseâ€“English test set for their experiments, of which only half were originally written in Chinese;  </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Effective Use of Transformer Networks for Entity Tracking, What evidence do they present that the model attends to shallow context clues?

Figure FIGREF37 shows that in this particular example, the most important model inputs are verbs possibly associated with the entity butter, in addition to the entity's mentions themselves. It further shows that the model learns to extract shallow clues of identifying actions exerted upon only the entity being tracked, regardless of other entities, by leveraging verb semantics. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Effective Use of Transformer Networks for Entity Tracking, In what way is the input restructured? [/INST] Our approach consists of structuring input to the transformer network to use and guide the self-attention of the transformers, conditioning it on the entity.

We also have an entity-last variant where the entity is primarily observed just before the classification token to condition the [CLS] token's self-attention accordingly. 
As an additional variation, we can either run the transformer once per document with multiple [CLS] tokens (a document-level model as shown in Figure FIGREF4) or specialize the prediction to a single timestep (a sentence-level model). </s>

This approach follows the entity-linking approach used by BIBREF11 Krishnamurthy2017NeuralSP, where the similarity between question tokens and (words associated with) entities - called the entity linking score - help decide which entities to include in the LF during parsing. </s>

The third is a CCG-style rule-based semantic parser written specifically for friction questions (the QuaRel INLINEFORM0 subset), but prior to data being collected. The last is a state-of-the-art neural semantic parser. We briefly describe each in turn. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper QuaRel: A Dataset and Models for Answering Questions about Qualitative Relationships, How do they obtain the logical forms of their questions in their dataset?

They then created a question, guided by a large number of examples, and were encouraged to be imaginative and use their own words.
Second, the LFs were elicited using a novel technique of reverse-engineering them from a set of follow-up questions, without exposing workers to the underlying formalism. This is possible because of the constrained space of LFs. Referring to LF templates (1) and (2) earlier (Section SECREF13 ), these questions are as follows:

From this information, we can deduce the target LF ( INLINEFORM0 is the complement of INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 , we arbitrarily set INLINEFORM3 =world1, hence all other variables can be inferred). </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Natural Language Interactions in Autonomous Vehicles: Intent Detection and Slot Filling from Passenger Utterances, What is shared in the joint model? [/INST] Using sequence-to-sequence networks, the approach here is jointly training annotated utterance-level intents and slots/intent keywords by adding / tokens to the beginning/end of each utterance, with utterance-level intent-type as labels of such tokens. Our approach is an extension of BIBREF2 , in which only an term is added with intent-type tags associated to this sentence final token, both for LSTM and Bi-LSTM cases. However, we experimented with adding both and terms as Bi-LSTMs will be used for seq2seq learning, and we observed that slightly better results can be achieved by doing so. The idea behind is that, since this is a seq2seq learning problem, at the last time step (i.e., prediction at ) the reverse pass in Bi-LSTM would be incomplete (refer to Fig. FIGREF24 (a) to observe the last Bi-LSTM cell). Therefore, adding token and leveraging the backward LSTM output at first time step (i.e., prediction at ) would potentially help for joint seq2seq learning. An overall network architecture can be found in Fig. FIGREF30 for our joint models. We will report the experimental results on two variations (with and without intent keywords) as follows:

<s>[INST] In the paper Gated Convolutional Neural Networks for Domain Adaptation, Does the fact that GCNs can perform well on this tell us that the task is simpler than previously thought?

This is largely because while training and testing on same domains, these models especially recurrent and attention based may perform better. However, for Domain Adaptation, as they lack gated structure which is trained in parallel to learn importance, their performance on target domain is poor as compared to gated architectures. As gated architectures are based on convolutions, they exploit parallelization to give significant boost in time complexity as compared to other models.
The effectiveness of gated architectures rely on the idea of training a gate with sole purpose of identifying a weightage. In the task of sentiment analysis this weightage corresponds to what weights will lead to a decrement in final loss or in other words, most accurate prediction of sentiment. In doing so, the gate architecture learns which words or n-grams contribute to the sentiment the most, these words or n-grams often co-relate with domain independent words.

<s>[INST] In the paper Assessing the Efficacy of Clinical Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction in Psychiatric Readmission Risk Prediction, What features are used? [/INST] 45 clinically interpretable features per admission were extracted as inputs to the readmission risk classifier. These features can be grouped into three categories (See Table TABREF5 for complete list of features):

Sociodemographics: gender, age, marital status, etc.

Past medical history: number of previous admissions, history of suicidality, average length of stay (up until that admission), etc.

Information from the current admission: length of stay (LOS), suicidal risk, number and length of notes, time of discharge, evaluation scores, etc.

The Current Admission feature group has the most number of features, with 29 features included in this group alone. These features can be further stratified into two groups: `structured' clinical features and `unstructured' clinical features.

Feature Extraction ::: Structured Features
Structure features are features that were identified on the EHR using regular expression matching and include rating scores that have been reported in the psychiatric literature as correlated with increased readmission risk, such as Global Assessment of Functioning, Insight and Compliance:

Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF): The psychosocial functioning of the patient ranging from 100 (extremely high functioning) to 1 (severely impaired) BIBREF13.

Insight: The degree to which the patient recognizes and accepts his/her illness (either Good, Fair or Poor).

Compliance: The ability of the patient to comply with medication and to follow medical advice (either Yes, Partial, or None).

These features are widely-used in clinical practice and evaluate the general state and prognosis of the patient during the patient's evaluation.

Feature Extraction ::: Unstructured Features
Unstructured features aim to capture the state of the patient in relation to seven risk factor domains (Appearance, Thought Process, Thought Content, Interpersonal, Substance Use, Occupation, and Mood) from the free-text narratives on the EHR. These seven domains have been identified as associated with readmission risk in prior work BIBREF14.

These unstructured features include: 1) the relative number of sentences in the admission notes that involve each risk factor domain (out of total number of sentences within the admission) and 2) clinical sentiment scores for each of these risk factor domains, i.e. sentiment scores that evaluate the patientâ€™s psychosocial functioning level (positive, negative, or neutral) with respect to each of these risk factor domain. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Assessing the Efficacy of Clinical Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction in Psychiatric Readmission Risk Prediction, Do they compare to previous models?

<s>[INST] In the paper Assessing the Efficacy of Clinical Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction in Psychiatric Readmission Risk Prediction, How do they incorporate sentiment analysis?

<s>[INST] In the paper Analysing Coreference in Transformer Outputs, What translationese effects are seen in the analysis? [/INST] Notably, automatic translations of TED talks contain more words than the corresponding reference translation, which means that machine-translated texts of this type have also more potential tokens to enter in a coreference relation, and potentially indicating a shining through effect. The same does not happen with the news test set.
We see how NMT translations increase the number of mentions about $30\%$ with respect to human references showing even a more marked explicitation effect than human translations do. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Analysing Coreference in Transformer Outputs, How are the (possibly incorrect) coreference chains in the MT outputs annotated? [/INST] We follow the same scheme as BIBREF47 to annotate the MT outputs with coreference chains. This scheme allows the annotator to define each markable as a certain mention type (pronoun, NP, VP or clause). The mentions can be defined further in terms of their cohesive function (antecedent, anaphoric, cataphoric, comparative, substitution, ellipsis, apposition). Antecedents can either be marked as simple or split or as entity or event. The annotation scheme also includes pronoun type (personal, possessive, demonstrative, reflexive, relative) and modifier types of NPs (possessive, demonstrative, definite article, or none for proper names), see BIBREF46 for details. The mentions referring to the same discourse item are linked between each other. We use the annotation tool MMAX2 BIBREF48 which was also used for the annotation of ParCorFull.
In the next step, chain members are annotated for their correctness. For the incorrect translations of mentions, we include the following error categories: gender, number, case, ambiguous and other. The latter category is open, which means that the annotators can add their own error types during the annotation process. With this, the final typology of errors also considered wrong named entity, wrong word, missing word, wrong syntactic structure, spelling error and addressee reference. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Analysing Coreference in Transformer Outputs, Which three neural machine translation systems are analyzed?

We concatenate pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe BIBREF40 and character embeddings trained by CharCNN BIBREF41 to represent input words. The $2d$ -dimension embedding vectors of input text $x_1, ... , x_n$ and query $q_1, ... , q_n$ are then fed into a Highway Layer BIBREF42 to improve the capability of word embeddings and character embeddings as

$$\begin{split} g_t &= {\rm sigmoid}(W_gx_t+b_g) \\ s_t &= {\rm relu } (W_xx_t+b_x) \\ u_t &= g_t \odot s_t + (1 - g_t) \odot x_t~. \end{split}$$ (Eq. 18)
The same Highway Layer is applied to $q_t$ and produces $v_t$ .
Next, $u_t$ and $v_t$ are fed into a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM) BIBREF44 respectively in order to model the temporal interactions between sequence words:
Then we feed $\mathbf {U}$ and $\mathbf {V}$ into the attention flow layer BIBREF27 to model the interactions between the input text and query.
Therefore, we introduce Self-Matching Layer BIBREF29 in our model as

$$\begin{split} o_t &= {\rm BiLSTM}(o_{t-1}, [h_t, c_t]) \\ s_j^t &= w^T {\rm tanh}(W_hh_j+\tilde{W_h}h_t)\\ \alpha _i^t &= {\rm exp}(s_i^t)/\Sigma _{j=1}^n{\rm exp}(s_j^t)\\ c_t &= \Sigma _{i=1}^n\alpha _i^th_i ~. \end{split}$$ (Eq. 20)
Finally we feed the embeddings $\mathbf {O} = [o_1, ... , o_n]$ into a Pointer Network BIBREF39 to decode the answer sequence as

$$\begin{split} p_t &= {\rm LSTM}(p_{t-1}, c_t) \\ s_j^t &= w^T {\rm tanh}(W_oo_j+W_pp_{t-1})\\ \beta _i^t &= {\rm exp}(s_i^t)/\Sigma _{j=1}^n{\rm exp}(s_j^t)\\ c_t &= \Sigma _{i=1}^n\beta _i^to_i~. \end{split}$$ (Eq. 21)
Therefore, the probability of generating the answer sequence $\textbf {a}$ is as follows

Code-mixing refers to the use of linguistic units from different languages in a single utterance or sentence, whereas code-switching refers to the co-occurrence of speech extracts belonging to two different grammatical systemsBIBREF3. This language interchange makes the grammar more complex and thus it becomes tough to handle it by traditional algorithms. Thus the presence of high percentage of code-mixed content in social media text has increased the complexity of the aggression detection task.

[/INST] The goal here being to assess if D2V could effectively replace the related-document function on PubMed, five different document similarity evaluations were designed as seen on figure FIGREF9. 
Methods ::: Evaluation ::: String length
To assess whether a similar length could lead to convergence of two documents, the size of the query document $D_{x}$ has been compared with the top-close document $C_{x}$ for 10,000 document randomly selected from the TeS after some pre-processing steps (stopwords and spaces were removed from both documents).
Methods ::: Evaluation ::: Words co-occurrences
A matrix of words co-occurrence was constructed on the total corpus from PubMed. Briefly, each document was lowered and tokenized. A matrix was filled with the number of times that two words co-occur in a single document. Then, for 5,000 documents $D_{x}$ from the TeS, all models were queried for the top-close document $C_{x}$. All possible combinations between all words $WD_{x} \in D_{x}$ and all words $WC_{x} \in C_{x}$ (excluding stopwords) were extracted, 500 couples were randomly selected and the number of times each of them was co-occurring was extracted from the matrix. The average value of this list was calculated, reflecting the proximity between D and C regarding their words content. This score was also calculated between each $D_{x}$ and the top-close document $C_{x}$ returned by the pmra algorithm.
Methods ::: Evaluation ::: Stems co-occurrences
The evaluation task explained above was also applied on 10,000 stemmed texts (using the Gensimâ€™s PorterStemmer to only keep wordâ€™s roots). The influence of the conjugation form or other suffixes can be assessed.
Methods ::: Evaluation ::: MeSH similarity
It is possible to compare the ability of both pmra and D2V to bring closer articles which were indexed with common labels. To do so, 5,000 documents $D_{x}$ randomly selected from the TeS were sent to both pmra and D2V architectures, and the top-five closer articles $C_{x}$ were extracted. The following rules were then applied to each MeSH found associated with $D_{x}$ for each document $C_{x_i}$ : add 1 to the score if this MeSH term is found in both $D_{x}$ and $C_{x_i}$, add 3 if this MeSH is defined as major topic and add 1 for each qualifier in common between $D_{x}$ and Cxi regarding this particular MeSH term. Then, the mean of these five scores was calculated for both pmra and D2V. </s>

Inconsistency may arise from the lack of decoding in solving this optimization problem. Maximum likelihood learning fits the model $p_{\theta }$ using the data distribution, whereas a decoded sequence from the trained model follows the distribution $q_{\mathcal {F}}$ induced by a decoding algorithm. Based on this discrepancy, we make a strong conjecture: we cannot be guaranteed to obtain a good consistent sequence generator using maximum likelihood learning and greedy decoding. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper ISS-MULT: Intelligent Sample Selection for Multi-Task Learning in Question Answering, How do they transfer the model? [/INST] this paper proposes to use the most relevant samples from the source dataset to train on the target dataset. One way to find the most similar samples is finding the pair-wise distance between all samples of the development set of the target dataset and source dataset.
we propose using a clustering algorithm on the development set. The clustering algorithm used ihere is a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The cosine similarity is used as a criteria to cluster each question and answer. Therefore, these clusters are representative of the development set of the target dataset and the corresponding center for each cluster is representative of all the samples on that cluster. In the next step, the distance of each center is used to calculate the cosine similarity. Finally, the samples in the source dataset which are far from these centers are ignored. In other words, the outliers do not take part in transfer learning. </s>

Este corpus fue constituido con aproximadamente 5 000 documentos (en su mayor parte libros) en espaÃ±ol. Los documentos originales, en formatos heterogÃ©neos, fueron procesados para crear un Ãºnico documento codificado en utf8. Las frases fueron segmentadas automÃ¡ticamente, usando un programa en PERL 5.0 y expresiones regulares, para obtener una frase por lÃ­nea.

Las caracterÃ­sticas del corpus 5KL se encuentran en la Tabla TABREF4. Este corpus es empleado para el entrenamiento de los modelos de aprendizaje profundo (Deep Learning, SecciÃ³n SECREF4).

El corpus literario 5KL posee la ventaja de ser muy extenso y adecuado para el aprendizaje automÃ¡tico. Tiene sin embargo, la desventaja de que no todas las frases son necesariamente â€œfrases literariasâ€. Muchas de ellas son frases de lengua general: estas frases a menudo otorgan una fluidez a la lectura y proporcionan los enlaces necesarios a las ideas expresadas en las frases literarias.

Otra desventaja de este corpus es el ruido que contiene. El proceso de segmentaciÃ³n puede producir errores en la detecciÃ³n de fronteras de frases. TambiÃ©n los nÃºmeros de pÃ¡gina, capÃ­tulos, secciones o Ã­ndices producen errores. No se realizÃ³ ningÃºn proceso manual de verificaciÃ³n, por lo que a veces se introducen informaciones indeseables: copyrights, datos de la ediciÃ³n u otros. Estas son, sin embargo, las condiciones que presenta un corpus literario real.

Un corpus heterogÃ©neo de casi 8 000 frases literarias fue constituido manualmente a partir de poemas, discursos, citas, cuentos y otras obras.

<s>[INST] In the paper Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Bi-sense Emoji Embedding and Attention-based LSTM, What evidence does visualizing the attention give to show that it helps to obtain a more robust understanding of semantics and sentiments? [/INST] In order to obtain insights about why the more fine-grained bi-sense emoji embedding helps in understanding the complexed sentiments behind tweets, we visualize the attention weights for ATT-E-LSTM and MATT-BiE-LSTM for comparison.
Therefore, we construct the new input INLINEFORM0 to each LSTM unit by concatenating the original word embedding and the attention vector in Equation EQREF21 to distribute the senti-emoji information to each step. This model is called Multi-level Attention-based LSTM with Bi-sense Emoji Embedding (MATT-BiE-LSTM)
Attention-based LSTM with emojis:We also use the word-emoji embedding to calculate the emoji-word attention following Equation EQREF20 and EQREF21 , and the only difference is that we replace the attention-derived senti-emoji embedding with the pre-trained word-emoji embedding by fasttext, denoted as ATT-E-LSTM.
In Figure FIGREF27 (a), the ATT-E-LSTM model (baseline) assigns relatively more weights on the word â€œnoâ€ and â€œpressureâ€, while MATT-BiE-LSTM attends mostly on the word â€œhappyâ€ and â€œlovelyâ€. The different attention distributions suggest that the proposed senti-emoji embedding is capable of recognizing words with strong sentiments that are closely related to the true sentiment even with the presence of words with conflicting sentiments, such as â€œpressureâ€ and â€œhappyâ€. while ATT-E-LSTM tends to pick up all sentimental words which could raise confusions. The senti-emoji embedding is capable of extracting representations of complexed semantics and sentiments which help guide the attentions even in cases when the word sentiment and emoji sentiment are somewhat contradictory to each other. From Figure FIGREF27 (b) and (c) we can observe that the ATT-E-LSTM assigns more weights on the sentiment-irrelevant words than the MATT-BiE-LSTM such as â€œhoodiesâ€, â€œwaitâ€ and â€œafterâ€, indicating that the proposed model is more robust to irrelevant words and concentrates better on important words. Because of the senti-emoji embedding obtained through bi-sense emoji embedding and the sentence-level LSTM encoding on the text input (described in Section SECREF13 ), we are able to construct a more robust embedding based on the semantic and sentiment information from the whole context compared to the word-emoji embedding used in ATT-E-LSTM which takes only word-level information into account. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Bi-sense Emoji Embedding and Attention-based LSTM, Which SOTA models are outperformed? [/INST] MATT-BiE-LSTM and WATT-BiE-LSTM obtain similar performances when tested on both Vader and human annotated samples, though their ways of computing the attention (weights and vectors) are different that WATT computes attention weights and the senti-emoji embeddings guided by each word, and MATT obtains the senti-emoji embedding based on the LSTM encoder on the whole contexts and computes the attention weights of the senti-emoji embedding across all words. Both models outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline models including ATT-E-LSTM
Attention-based LSTM with emojis:We also use the word-emoji embedding to calculate the emoji-word attention following Equation EQREF20 and EQREF21 , and the only difference is that we replace the attention-derived senti-emoji embedding with the pre-trained word-emoji embedding by fasttext, denoted as ATT-E-LSTM.

<s>[INST] In the paper Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Bi-sense Emoji Embedding and Attention-based LSTM, What is the baseline for experiments? [/INST] We set up the baselines and proposed models as follows:
LSTM with text embedding: CNNs and LSTMs are widely used to encode textual contents for sentiment analysis in BIBREF45 , BIBREF46 and many online tutorials. Here we select the standard LSTM with pre-trained word embedding as input, and add one fully-connected layer with sigmoid activation top of the LSTM encoder (same as all other models), denoted as T-LSTM.
LSTM with emoji embedding: We consider the emoji as one special word and input both pre-trained text and emoji embeddings into the same LSTM network, namely E-LSTM. Similarly, we concatenate the pre-trained bi-sense emoji embedding as one special word to feed into the LSTM network. This model is called BiE-LSTM.
Attention-based LSTM with emojis:We also use the word-emoji embedding to calculate the emoji-word attention following Equation EQREF20 and EQREF21 , and the only difference is that we replace the attention-derived senti-emoji embedding with the pre-trained word-emoji embedding by fasttext, denoted as ATT-E-LSTM. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Bi-sense Emoji Embedding and Attention-based LSTM, What is the motivation for training bi-sense embeddings? [/INST] The extensive use of emojis has drawn a growing attention from researchers BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 because the emojis convey fruitful semantical and sentimental information to visually complement the textual information which is significantly useful in understanding the embedded emotional signals in texts BIBREF6 
However, the previous literatures lack in considerations of the linguistic complexities and diversity of emoji. Therefore, previous emoji embedding methods fail to handle the situation when the semantics or sentiments of the learned emoji embeddings contradict the information from the corresponding contexts BIBREF5 , or when the emojis convey multiple senses of semantics and sentiments such as ( and ). In practice, emojis can either summarize and emphasis the original tune of their contexts, or express more complex semantics such as irony and sarcasm by being combined with contexts of contradictory semantics or sentiments.
Conventional emoji analysis can only extract single embedding of each emoji, and such embeddings will confuse the following sentiment analysis model by inconsistent sentiment signals from the input texts and emojis </s>

Each summary consists of several sentences of the original text, selected by a human expert. Some sentences are slightly modified and are not, therefore, an exact copy of any original sentences. Documents are categorized into six categories such as political, economic and so on. The length of documents ranges from 4 to 156 sentences. Overall, it has about 2,500 sentences. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Features in Extractive Supervised Single-document Summarization: Case of Persian News, What features of the document are integrated into vectors of every sentence? [/INST] Incorporating Document Features ::: Learning Phase ::: Feature Extraction ::: Document-unaware Features
Ordinal position: It is shown that inclusion of sentence, in summary, is relevant to its position in the document or even in a paragraph. Intuitively, sentences at the beginning or the end of a text are more likely to be included in the summary. Depending on how it is defined, this feature might be document-unaware or not. For example, in BIBREF29 and BIBREF37 it is defined as $\frac{5}{5}$ for the first sentence, $\frac{4}{5}$ for the second, and so on to $\frac{1}{5}$ for fifth and zero for remaining sentences. In another research conducted by Wong et al. BIBREF9, it is defined as $\frac{1}{sentence\ number}$. With such a definition, we may have several sentences, for example, with position=$\frac{1}{5}$ in the training set, these may not have the same sense of position. While a sentence position=$\frac{1}{5}$ means â€œamong the firstsâ€ in a document with 40 sentences, it has a totally different meaning of â€œin the middleâ€, in another document containing 10 sentences. Thus, a useful feature formula should involve differences of documents which may change the meaning of information within it. In our experiments, we used the definition of BIBREF9. A document-aware version of position will be introduced in (SECREF6).

Length of sentence: the intuition behind this feature is that sentences of too long or too short length are less likely to be included in the summary. Like sentence position, this feature is also subject to the wrong definition that makes it document-unaware. For example, in BIBREF9 it is defined as a number of words in a sentence. Such a definition does not take into account that a sentence with, say 15 words may be considered long if all other sentences of document have fewer words. Another sentence with the same number of words may be regarded as short, because other sentences in that document have more than 15 words. This might occur due to different writing styles. However, we included this in our experiments to compare its effect with that of its document-aware counterpart, which will be listed in (SECREF6).

The Ratio of Nouns: is defined in BIBREF30 as the number of nouns divided by total number of words in the sentence, after stop-words are removed. Three other features, Ratio of Verbs, Ratio of Adjectives, and Ratio of Adverbs are defined in the same manner and proved to have a positive effect on ranking performance. From our perspective, however, a sentence with a ratio of nouns =0.5, for example, in a document containing many nouns, must be discriminated in the training set from another sentence with the same ratio of nouns, that appeared in another document having fewer nouns. This feature does not represent how many nouns are there in the document, which is important in sentence ranking. The same discussion goes on to justify the need to consider the number of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in the document. The impact of these features is examined in our experiments and compared to that of their document-aware counterparts.

The Ratio of Numerical entities: assuming that sentences containing more numerical data are probably giving us more information, this feature may help us in ranking BIBREF31, BIBREF32. For calculation, we count the occurrences of numbers and digits proportional to the length of sentence. This feature must be less weighted if almost all sentences of a document have numerical data. However, it does not count numbers and digits in other sentences of the document.

Cue Words: if a sentence contains special phrases such as â€œin conclusionâ€, â€œoverallâ€, â€œto summarizeâ€, â€œin a nutshellâ€ and so forth, its selection as a part of the summary is more probable than others. The number of these phrases is counted for this feature.

Incorporating Document Features ::: Learning Phase ::: Feature Extraction ::: Document-aware Features
Cosine position: As mentioned in (SECREF5) a good definition of position should take into account document length. A well-known formula used in the literature BIBREF38, BIBREF7 is

in which index is an integer representing the order of sentences and T is the total number of sentences in document. This feature ranges from 0 to 1, the closer to the beginning or to the end, the higher value this feature will take. $\alpha $ is a tuning parameter. As it increases, the value of this feature will be distributed more equally over sentences. In this manner, equal values of this feature in the training set represent a uniform notion of position in a document, so it becomes document-aware.

Relative Length: the intuition behind this feature is explained in (SECREF5). A discussion went there that a simple count of words does not take into account that a sentence with a certain number of words may be considered long or short, based on the other sentences appeared the document. Taking this into consideration, we divided the number of words in the sentence by the average length of sentences in the document. More formally, the formula is:

in which n is number of sentences in the document and $s_i$ is the iâ€™th sentence of it. Values greater than 1 could be interpreted as long and vice versa.

TF-ISF: this feature counts the frequency of terms in a document and assigns higher values to sentences having more frequent terms. It also discounts terms which appear in more sentences. Since it is well explained in the literature, we have not included details and formula which are in references BIBREF34 and BIBREF39. Nonetheless, the aspect that matters in our discussion is that both frequency and inverse sentence frequency are terms which involve properties of context, and consequently are document-aware.

POS features: Here we introduce another way to include the ratio of part of speech (POS) units in features and keep them document-normalized. To do this, the number of occurrences of each POS unit should be divided by the number of them in the document, instead of that occurring in a sentence. The formal definition of the new document-aware features are as follows:

Incorporating Document Features ::: Learning Phase ::: Feature Extraction ::: Explicit Document Features
In order to further investigate how effective are document specific features in sentence ranking, we defined several features for documents. These features are then calculated for each document and repeated in the feature vector of every sentence of that document. Their formal definition is described below and their effect is examined in the result and discussion section (SECREF5):

Document sentences: An important property of a document that affects summarization is the total number of sentences participating in sentence ranking. As this number grows, a summarizer should be more selective and precise. Also, some sentence features such as cue words, maybe more weighted for longer documents. In addition, the main contextual information is probably more distributed over sentences. In such a case even lower values of other features should be considered important.

Document words: the number of words in the document is another notion of document length. Since the number of sentences alone is not enough to represent document length, this feature should also be considered.

Topical category: different topics such as political, economic, etc. have different writing styles and this might affect sentence ranking. For instance, numerical entities may appear more in economic or sport reports than in religious or social news. Therefore the weight of this attribute should be more or less, based on a documentâ€™s category. So it needs to be included. </s>

Since the number of target labels are high, achieving the higher accuracy is difficult, while keeping all the categories under same feature selection method. Some categories performs well with lower TF-IDF vectorizing range and higher n grams features even though they showed lower accuracy in the overall single model. Therefore, hierarchical machine learning models are built to classify 31 categories in the first classification model and remaining categories are named as low-accu and predicted as one category. In the next model, predicted low-accu categories are again classified into 47 categories. Comparatively this hierarchical model works well since various feature selection methods are used for various categoriesBIBREF5. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper "How May I Help You?": Modeling Twitter Customer Service Conversations Using Fine-Grained Dialogue Acts, Which patterns and rules are derived? [/INST] By analyzing large numbers of dialogue act sequences correlated with specific outcomes, various rules can be derived, i.e. "Continuing to request information late in a conversation often leads to customer dissatisfaction." This can then be codified into a best practice pattern rules for automated systems, such as "A request for information act should be issued early in a conversation, followed by an answer, informative statement, or apology towards the end of the conversation."
Our analysis helps zone in on how the use of certain dialogue acts may be likely to result in different outcomes. The weights we observe vary in the amount of insight provided: for example, offering extra help at the end of a conversation, or thanking the customer yields more satisfied customers, and more resolved problems (with ratios of above 6:1). However, some outcomes are much more subtle: for example, asking yes-no questions early-on in a conversation is highly associated with problem resolution (ratio 3:1), but asking them at the end of a conversation has as similarly strong association with unsatisfied customers. Giving elaborate answers that are not a simple affirmative, negative, or response acknowledgement (i.e. Answer (Other)) towards the middle of a conversation leads to satisfied customers that are not frustrated. Likewise, requesting information towards the end of a conversation (implying that more information is still necessary at the termination of the dialogue) leads to unsatisfied and unresolved customers, with ratios of at least 4:1. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Building a Neural Machine Translation System Using Only Synthetic Parallel Data, How many improvements on the French-German translation benchmark? [/INST] While the mixing strategy compensates for most of the gap between the Fr-De* and the Fr*-De (3.01 $\rightarrow $ 0.17) in the De $\rightarrow $ Fr case, the resulting PSEUDOmix still shows lower BLEU than the target-originated Fr-De* corpus. We thus enhance the quality of the synthetic examples of the source-originated Fr*-De data by further training its mother translation model (En $\rightarrow $ Fr). As illustrated in Figure 2 , with the target-originated Fr-De* corpus being fixed, the quality of the models trained with the source-originated Fr*-De data and PSEUDOmix increases in proportion to the quality of the mother model for the Fr*-De corpus. Eventually, PSEUDOmix shows the highest BLEU, outperforming both Fr*-De and Fr-De* data. 
As presented in Table 6 , we observe that fine-tuning using ground truth parallel data brings substantial improvements in the translation qualities of all NMT models. Among all fine-tuned models, PSEUDOmix shows the best performance in all experiments. This is particularly encouraging for the case of De $\rightarrow $ Fr, where PSEUDOmix reported lower BLEU than the Fr-De* data before it was fine-tuned. Even in the case where PSEUDOmix shows comparable results with other synthetic corpora in the Pseudo Only scenario, it shows higher improvements in the translation quality when fine-tuned with the real parallel data.  </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Multilingual Graphemic Hybrid ASR with Massive Data Augmentation, What are the best within-language data augmentation methods? [/INST] In this section, we consider 3 categories of data augmentation techniques that are effectively applicable to video datasets.
To further increase training data size and diversity, we can create new audios via superimposing each original audio with additional noisy audios in time domain. To obtain diverse noisy audios, we use AudioSet, which consists of 632 audio event classes and a collection of over 2 million manually-annotated 10-second sound clips from YouTube videos BIBREF28.
We consider applying the frequency and time masking techniques â€“ which are shown to greatly improve the performance of end-to-end ASR models BIBREF23 â€“ to our hybrid systems. Similarly, they can be applied online during each epoch of LF-MMI training, without the need for realignment.

Consider each utterance (i.e. after the audio segmentation in Section SECREF5), and we compute its log mel spectrogram with $\nu $ dimension and $\tau $ time steps:

Frequency masking is applied $m_F$ times, and each time the frequency bands $[f_0$, $f_0+ f)$ are masked, where $f$ is sampled from $[0, F]$ and $f_0$ is sampled from $[0, \nu - f)$.

Time masking is optionally applied $m_T$ times, and each time the time steps $[t_0$, $t_0+ t)$ are masked, where $t$ is sampled from $[0, T]$ and $t_0$ is sampled from $[0, \tau - t)$.
Data augmentation ::: Speed and volume perturbation
Both speed and volume perturbation emulate mean shifts in spectrum BIBREF18, BIBREF19. To perform speed perturbation of the training data, we produce three versions of each audio with speed factors $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1$. The training data size is thus tripled. For volume perturbation, each audio is scaled with a random variable drawn from a uniform distribution $[0.125, 2]$. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Weighed Domain-Invariant Representation Learning for Cross-domain Sentiment Analysis, How are different domains weighted in WDIRL? [/INST] According to the above analysis
According to the above analysis, we proposed a weighted version of DIRL to address the problem caused by the shift of $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$ to DIRL. The key idea of this framework is to first align $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$ across domains before performing domain-invariant learning, and then take account the shift of $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$ in the label prediction procedure. Specifically, it introduces a class weight $\mathbf {w}$ to weigh source domain examples by class. Based on the weighted source domain, the domain shift problem is resolved in two steps. 
The motivation behind this practice is to adjust data distribution of the source domain or the target domain to alleviate the shift of $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$ across domains before applying DIRL. Consider that we only have labels of source domain data, we choose to adjust data distribution of the source domain. To achieve this purpose, we introduce a trainable class weight $\mathbf {w}$ to reweigh source domain examples by class when performing DIRL, with $\mathbf {w}_i > 0$. Specifically, we hope that:

and we denote $\mathbf {w}^*$ the value of $\mathbf {w}$ that makes this equation hold. 
We shall see that when $\mathbf {w}=\mathbf {w}^*$, DIRL is to align $\rm {P}_S(G(\rm {X})|\rm {Y})$ with $\rm {P}_T(G(\rm {X})|\rm {Y})$ without the shift of $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$. According to our analysis, we know that due to the shift of $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$, there is a conflict between the training objects of the supervised learning $\mathcal {L}_{sup}$ and the domain-invariant learning $\mathcal {L}_{inv}$. And the conflict degree will decrease as $\rm {P}_S(\rm {Y})$ getting close to $\rm {P}_T(\rm {Y})$. Therefore, during model training, $\mathbf {w}$ is expected to be optimized toward $\mathbf {w}^*$ since it will make $\rm {P}(\rm {Y})$ of the weighted source domain close to $\rm {P}_T(\rm {Y})$, so as to solve the conflict. </s>

Although larger joke datasets exist, the r/Jokes thread is unparalleled in the amount of rated jokes it contains. To the best of our knowledge there is no comparable source of rated jokes in any other language. These Reddit posts consist of the body of the joke, the punchline, and the number of reactions or upvotes. Although this type of humor may only be most enjoyable to a subset of the population, it is an effective way to measure responses to jokes in a large group setting. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Humor Detection: A Transformer Gets the Last Laugh, How they evaluate if joke is humorous or not? [/INST] Our Reddit data was gathered using Reddit's public API, collecting the most recent jokes. Every time the scraper ran, it also updated the upvote score of the previously gathered jokes. This data collection occurred every hour through the months of March and April 2019. Since the data was already split into body and punchline sections from Reddit, we created separate datasets containing the body of the joke exclusively and the punchline of the joke exclusively. Additionally, we created a dataset that combined the body and punchline together.

Some sample jokes are shown in Table 1, above. The distribution of joke scores varies wildly, ranging from 0 to 136,354 upvotes. We found that there is a major jump between the 0-200 upvote range and the 200 range and onwards, with only 6% of jokes scoring between 200-20,000. We used this natural divide as the cutoff to decide what qualified as a funny joke, giving us 13884 not-funny jokes and 2025 funny jokes. </s>

we consider mentions spans in $S_q$ exactly matching an element of $C_q \cup \lbrace s\rbrace $ . Admittedly, this is a rather simple strategy which may suffer from low recall.

<s>[INST] In the paper RaKUn: Rank-based Keyword extraction via Unsupervised learning and Meta vertex aggregation, How are meta vertices computed? [/INST] Even if the optional lemmatization step is applied, one can still aim at further reducing the graph complexity by merging similar vertices. This step is called meta vertex construction.
The meta-vertex construction step works as follows. Let INLINEFORM0 represent the set of vertices, as defined above. A meta vertex INLINEFORM1 is comprised of a set of vertices that are elements of INLINEFORM2 , i.e. INLINEFORM3 . Let INLINEFORM4 denote the INLINEFORM5 -th meta vertex. We construct a given INLINEFORM6 so that for each INLINEFORM7 , INLINEFORM8 's initial edges (prior to merging it into a meta vertex) are rewired to the newly added INLINEFORM9 . Note that such edges connect to vertices which are not a part of INLINEFORM10 . Thus, both the number of vertices, as well as edges get reduced substantially. This feature is implemented via the following procedure:
Meta vertex candidate identification. Edit distance and word lengths distance are used to determine whether two words should be merged into a meta vertex (only if length distance threshold is met, the more expensive edit distance is computed).
The meta vertex creation. As common identifiers, we use the stemmed version of the original vertices and if there is more than one resulting stem, we select the vertex from the identified candidates that has the highest centrality value in the graph and its stemmed version is introduced as a novel vertex (meta vertex). </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper RaKUn: Rank-based Keyword extraction via Unsupervised learning and Meta vertex aggregation, How are graphs derived from a given text? [/INST] In this work we consider directed graphs. Let INLINEFORM0 represent a graph comprised of a set of vertices INLINEFORM1 and a set of edges ( INLINEFORM2 ), which are ordered pairs. Further, each edge can have a real-valued weight assigned. Let INLINEFORM3 represent a document comprised of tokens INLINEFORM4 . The order in which tokens in text appear is known, thus INLINEFORM5 is a totally ordered set. A potential way of constructing a graph from a document is by simply observing word co-occurrences. When two words co-occur, they are used as an edge. However, such approaches do not take into account the sequence nature of the words, meaning that the order is lost. We attempt to take this aspect into account as follows. The given corpus is traversed, and for each element INLINEFORM6 , its successor INLINEFORM7 , together with a given element, forms a directed edge INLINEFORM8 . Finally, such edges are weighted according to the number of times they appear in a given corpus. Thus the graph, constructed after traversing a given corpus, consists of all local neighborhoods (order one), merged into a single joint structure. Global contextual information is potentially kept intact (via weights), even though it needs to be detected via network analysis as proposed next. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper TutorialVQA: Question Answering Dataset for Tutorial Videos, What baseline algorithms were presented? [/INST] Our video question answering task is novel and to our knowledge, no model has been designed specifically for this task. As a first step towards solving this problem, we evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art models developed for other QA tasks, including a sentence-level prediction task and two segment retrieval tasks.
Baselines ::: Baseline1: Sentence-level prediction
Given a transcript (a sequence of sentences) and a question, Baseline1 predicts (starting sentence index, ending sentence index). The model is based on RaSor BIBREF13, which has been developed for the SQuAD QA task BIBREF6. RaSor concatenates the embedding vectors of the starting and the ending words to represent a span. Following this idea, Baseline1 represents a span of sentences by concatenating the vectors of the starting and ending sentences. The left diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline1 model.

Model. The model takes two inputs, a transcript, $\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_n\rbrace $ where $s_i$ are individual sentences and a question, $q$. The output is the span scores, $y$, the scores over all possible spans. GLoVe BIBREF14 is used for the word representations in the transcript and the questions. We use two bi-LSTMs BIBREF15 to encode the transcript.

where n is the number of sentences . The output of Passage-level Encoding, $p$, is a sequence of vector, $p_i$, which represents the latent meaning of each sentence. Then, the model combines each pair of sentence embeddings ($p_i$, $p_j$) to generate a span embedding.

where [$\cdot $,$\cdot $] indicates the concatenation. Finally, we use a one-layer feed forward network to compute a score between each span and a question.

In training, we use cross-entropy as an objective function. In testing, the span with the highest score is picked as an answer.
Baselines ::: Baseline2: Segment retrieval
We also considered a simpler task by casting our problem as a retrieval task. Specifically, in addition to a plain transcript, we also provided the model with the segmentation information which was created during the data collection phrase (See Section. SECREF3). Note that each segments corresponds to a candidate answer. Then, the task is to pick the best segment for given a query. This task is easier than Baseline1's task in that the segmentation information is provided to the model. Unlike Baseline1, however, it is unable to return an answer span at various granularities. Baseline2 is based on the attentive LSTM BIBREF17, which has been developed for the InsuranceQA task. The right diagram in Fig. FIGREF15 illustrates the Baseline2 model.

Model. The two inputs, $s$ and $q$ represent the segment text and a question. The model first encodes the two inputs.

$h^s$ is then re-weighted using attention weights.

where $\odot $ denotes the element-wise multiplication operation. The final score is computed using a one-layer feed-forward network.

During training, the model requires negative samples. For each positive example, (question, ground-truth segment), all the other segments in the same transcript are used as negative samples. Cross entropy is used as an objective function.


Baselines ::: Baseline3: Pipeline Segment retrieval
We construct a pipelined approach through another segment retrieval task, calculating the cosine similarities between the segment and question embeddings. In this task however, we want to test the accuracy of retrieving the segments given that we first retrieve the correct video from our 76 videos. First, we generate the TF-IDF embeddings for the whole video transcripts and questions. The next step involves retrieving the videos which have the lowest cosine distance between the video transcripts and question. We then filter and store the top ten videos, reducing the number of computations required in the next step. Finally, we calculate the cosine distances between the question and the segments which belong to the filtered top 10 videos, marking it as correct if found in these videos. While the task is less computationally expensive than the previous baseline, we do not learn the segment representations, as this task is a simple retrieval task based on TF-IDF embeddings.

Model. The first two inputs are are the question, q, and video transcript, v, encoded by their TF-IDF vectors: BIBREF18:

We then filter the top 10 video transcripts(out of 76) with the minimum cosine distance, and further compute the TF-IDF vectors for their segments, Stop10n, where n = 10. We repeat the process for the corresponding segments:

selecting the segment with the minimal cosine distance distance to the query. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Towards Neural Language Evaluators, What are the three limitations? [/INST] In this part, we discuss three significant limitations of BLEU and ROUGE. These metrics can assign: High scores to semantically opposite translations/summaries, Low scores to semantically related translations/summaries and High scores to unintelligible translations/summaries.

Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: High score, opposite meanings
Suppose that we have a reference summary s1. By adding a few negation terms to s1, one can create a summary s2 which is semantically opposite to s1 but yet has a high BLEU/ROUGE score.

Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: Low score, similar meanings
In addition not to be sensitive to negation, BLEU and ROUGE score can give low scores to sentences with equivalent meaning. If s2 is a paraphrase of s1, the meaning will be the same ;however, the overlap between words in s1 and s2 will not necessarily be significant.

Challenges with BLEU and ROUGE ::: High score, unintelligible sentences
A third weakness of BLEU and ROUGE is that in their simplest implementations, they are insensitive to word permutation and can give very high scores to unintelligible sentences. Let s1 be "On a morning, I saw a man running in the street." and s2 be â€œOn morning a, I saw the running a man streetâ€. s2 is not an intelligible sentence. The unigram version of ROUGE and BLEU will give these 2 sentences a score of 1. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Local Contextual Attention with Hierarchical Structure for Dialogue Act Recognition, What is dialogue act recognition? [/INST] Dialogue act (DA) characterizes the type of a speaker's intention in the course of producing an utterance and is approximately equivalent to the illocutionary act of BIBREF0 or the speech act of BIBREF1. The recognition of DA is essential for modeling and automatically detecting discourse structure, especially in developing a human-machine dialogue system. It is natural to predict the Answer acts following an utterance of type Question, and then match the Question utterance to each QA-pair in the knowledge base. The predicted DA can also guide the response generation process BIBREF2. For instance, system generates a Greeting type response to former Greeting type utterance.
DA recognition is aimed to assign a label to each utterance in a conversation. It can be formulated as a supervised classification problem. There are two trends to solve this problem: 1) as a sequence labeling problem, it will predict the labels for all utterances in the whole dialogue history BIBREF13, BIBREF14, BIBREF9; 2) as a sentence classification problem, it will treat utterance independently without any context history BIBREF5, BIBREF15.  </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Select and Attend: Towards Controllable Content Selection in Text Generation, Does the performance necessarily drop when more control is desired? [/INST] The main reason is that when the controllability is strong, the change of selection will directly affect the text realization so that a tiny error of content selection might lead to unrealistic text. If the selector is not perfectly trained, the fluency will inevitably be influenced. When the controllability is weaker, like in RS, the fluency is more stable because it will not be affected much by the selection mask. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Select and Attend: Towards Controllable Content Selection in Text Generation, How is the model trained to do only content selection? [/INST] Our goal is to decouple the content selection from the decoder by introducing an extra content selector.
The most intuitive way is training the content selector to target some heuristically extracted contents. For example, we can train the selector to select overlapped words between the source and target BIBREF6 , sentences with higher tf-idf scores BIBREF20 or identified image objects that appear in the caption BIBREF21 .
INLINEFORM0 as Latent Variable: Another way is to treat INLINEFORM1 as a latent variable and co-train selector and generator by maximizing the marginal data likelihood. By doing so, the selector has the potential to automatically explore optimal selecting strategies best fit for the corresponding generator component.

[/INST] The basic concept is to use a phone-discriminative model to produce frame-level phonetic features, and then use these features to enhance RNN LID systems that were originally built with raw acoustic features. The initial step is therefore feature combination, with the phonetic feature used as auxiliary information to assist acoustic RNN LID. This is improved further, as additional research identified that a simpler model using only the phonetic feature as the RNN LID input provides even better performance. We call this RNN model based on phonetic features the phonetic temporal neural LID approach, or PTN LID. As well as having a simplified model structure, the PTN offers deeper insight into the LID task by rediscovering the value of the phonetic temporal property in language discrimination.  </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper On Evaluating the Generalization of LSTM Models in Formal Languages, What training settings did they try? [/INST] Training and testing are done in alternating steps: In each epoch, for training, we first present to an LSTM network 1000 samples in a given language, which are generated according to a certain discrete probability distribution supported on a closed finite interval. We then freeze all the weights in our model, exhaustively enumerate all the sequences in the language by their lengths, and determine the first $k$ shortest sequences whose outputs the model produces inaccurately. 
experimented with 1, 2, 3, and 36 hidden units for $a^n b^n$ ; 2, 3, 4, and 36 hidden units for $a^n b^n c^n$ ; and 3, 4, 5, and 36 hidden units for $a^n b^n c^n d^n$ . 
Following the traditional approach adopted by BIBREF7 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF9 and many other studies, we train our neural network as follows. At each time step, we present one input character to our model and then ask it to predict the set of next possible characters, based on the current character and the prior hidden states. Given a vocabulary $\mathcal {V}^{(i)}$ of size $d$ , we use a one-hot representation to encode the input values; therefore, all the input vectors are $d$ -dimensional binary vectors. The output values are $(d+1)$ -dimensional though, since they may further contain the termination symbol $\dashv $ , in addition to the symbols in $\mathcal {V}^{(i)}$ . The output values are not always one-hot encoded, because there can be multiple possibilities for the next character in the sequence, therefore we instead use a $k$ -hot representation to encode the output values. Our objective is to minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of the sequence predictions. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper On Evaluating the Generalization of LSTM Models in Formal Languages, How do they get the formal languages? [/INST] Later, BIBREF8 introduced an RNN with an external stack memory to learn simple context-free languages, such as $a^n b^m$ , $a^nb^ncb^ma^m$ , and $a^{n+m} b^n c^m$ . Similar studies BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 have explored the existence of stable counting mechanisms in simple RNNs, which would enable them to learn various context-free and context-sensitive languages
BIBREF9 , on the other hand, proposed a variant of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to learn two context-free languages, $a^n b^n$ , $a^n b^m B^m A^n$ , and one strictly context-sensitive language, $a^n b^n c^n$ . </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper On Evaluating the Generalization of LSTM Models in Formal Languages, Are the unobserved samples from the same distribution as the training data? [/INST] Furthermore, we do not restrict ourselves to a test set of sequences of fixed lengths during testing. Rather, we exhaustively enumerate all the sequences in a language by their lengths and then go through the sequences in the test set one by one until our network errs $k$ times, thereby providing a more fine-grained evaluation criterion of its generalization capabilities.
To study the effect of various length distributions on the learning capability and speed of LSTM models, we experimented with four discrete probability distributions supported on bounded intervals (Figure 2 ) to sample the lengths of sequences for the languages.  </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Data Interpretation over Plots, What models other than SAN-VOES are trained on new PlotQA dataset? [/INST] We compare the performance of the following models:

- QUES-only: This is a simple baseline where we just pass the question through a LSTM and use the embedding of the question to predict the answer from a fixed vocabulary.

- SANBIBREF2: This is a state of the art VQA model which is an encoder-decoder model with a multi-layer stacked attention BIBREF26 mechanism. It obtains a representation for the image using a deep CNN and a representation for the query using LSTM. It then uses the query representation to locate relevant regions in the image and uses this to pick an answer from a fixed vocabulary.

- SANDYBIBREF1: This is the best performing model on the DVQA dataset and is a variant of SAN. Unfortunately, the code for this model is not available and the description in the paper was not detailed enough for us to reimplement it. Hence, we report the numbers for this model only on DVQA (from the original paper).

- VOES: This is our model as described in section SECREF3 which is specifically designed for questions which do not have answers from a fixed vocabulary.

- VOES-Oracle: blackThis is our model where the first three stages of VOES are replaced by an Oracle, i.e., the QA model answers questions on a table that has been generated using the ground truth annotations of the plot. With this we can evaluate the performance of the WikiTableQA model when it is not affected by the VED model's errors.

- SAN-VOES: Given the complementary strengths of SAN-VQA and VOES, we train a hybrid model with a binary classifier which given a question decides whether to use the SAN or the VOES model. The data for training this binary classifier is generated by comparing the predictions of a trained SAN model and a trained VOES model on the training dataset. For a given question, the label is set to 1 (pick SAN) if the performance of SAN was better than that of VOES. We ignore questions where there is a tie. The classifier is a simple LSTM based model which computes a representation for the question using an LSTM and uses this representation to predict 1/0. At test time, we first pass the question through this model and depending on the output of this model use SAN or VOES. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Sentiment Analysis for Twitter : Going Beyond Tweet Text, What linguistic features are used? [/INST] We use two basic features:

Parts of Speech (POS) tags: We use the POS tagger of NLTK to tag the tweet texts BIBREF0 . We use counts of noun, adjective, adverb, verb words in a tweet as POS features.

Prior polarity of the words: We use a polarity dictionary BIBREF3 to get the prior polarity of words. The dictionary contains positive, negative and neutral words along with their polarity strength (weak or strong). The polarity of a word is dependent on its POS tag. For example, the word `excuse' is negative when used as `noun' or `adjective', but it carries a positive sense when used as a `verb'. We use the tags produced by NLTK postagger while selecting the prior polarity of a word from the dictionary. We also employ stemming (Porter Stemmer implementation from NLTK) while performing the dictionary lookup to increase number of matches. We use the counts of weak positive words, weak negative words, strong positive words and strong negative words in a tweet as features.

We have also explored some advanced features that helps improve detecting sentiment of tweets.

Emoticons: We use the emoticon dictionary from BIBREF2 , and count the positive and negtive emocicons for each tweet.

The sentiment of url: Since almost all the articles are written in well-formatted english, we analyze the sentiment of the first paragraph of the article using Standford Sentiment Analysis tool BIBREF4 . It predicts sentiment for each sentence within the article. We calculate the fraction of sentences that are negative, positive, and neutral and use these three values as features.

Hashtag: We count the number of hashtags in each tweet.

Capitalization: We assume that capitalization in the tweets has some relationship with the degree of sentiment. We count the number of words with capitalization in the tweets.

Retweet: This is a boolean feature indicating whether the tweet is a retweet or not.

User Mention: A boolean feature indicating whether the tweet contains a user mention.

Negation: Words like `no', `not', `won't' are called negation words since they negate the meaning of the word that is following it. As for example `good' becomes `not good'. We detect all the negation words in the tweets. If a negation word is followed by a polarity word, then we negate the polarity of that word. For example, if `good' is preceeded by a `not', we change the polarity from `weak positive' to `weak negative'.

Text Feature: We use tf-idf based text features to predict the sentiment of a tweet. We perform tf-idf based scoring of words in a tweet and the hashtags present in the tweets. We use the tf-idf vectors to train a classifier and predict the sentiment. This is then used as a stacked prediction feature in the final classifier. </s>

In order to make the $o_j$ vectors (of dimension $2048+4=2052$) comparable to BERT embeddings (of dimension 768), we use a simple linear cross-modal projection layer $W$ of dimensions $2052\hspace{-1.00006pt}\times \hspace{-1.00006pt}768$. The $N$ object regions detected in an image, are thus represented as $X_{img} = (W.o_1,...,W.o_N)$.

Ablation over the paragraph-level and sentence-level neural retrieval sub-modules on HOTPOTQA. Shows the ablation results for the two neural retrieval modules at both paragraph and sentence level on HotpotQA and FEVER. To begin with, we can see that removing paragraph-level retrieval module significantly reduces the precision for sentence-level retrieval and the corresponding F1 on both tasks. More importantly, this loss of retrieval precision also led to substantial decreases for all the downstream scores on both QA and verification task in spite of their higher upper-bound and recall scores. This indicates that the negative effects on downstream module induced by the omission of paragraph-level retrieval can not be amended by the sentence-level retrieval module, and focusing semantic retrieval merely on improving the recall or the upper-bound of final score will risk jeopardizing the performance of the overall system.

Next, the removal of sentence-level retrieval module induces a $\sim $2 point drop on EM and F1 score in the QA task, and a $\sim $15 point drop on FEVER Score in the verification task. This suggests that rather than just enhance explainability for QA, the sentence-level retrieval module can also help pinpoint relevant information and reduce the noise in the evidence that might otherwise distract the downstream comprehension module. Another interesting finding is that without sentence-level retrieval module, the QA module suffered much less than the verification module; conversely, the removal of paragraph-level retrieval neural induces a 11 point drop on answer EM comparing to a $\sim $9 point drop on Label Accuracy in the verification task. This seems to indicate that the downstream QA module relies more on the upstream paragraph-level retrieval whereas the verification module relies more on the upstream sentence-level retrieval. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Towards Real-Time, Country-Level Location Classification of Worldwide Tweets, What are the eight features mentioned? [/INST] We created eight different classifiers, each of which used one of the following eight features available from a tweet as retrieved from a stream of the Twitter API:

User location (uloc): This is the location the user specifies in their profile. While this feature might seem a priori useful, it is somewhat limited as this is a free text field that users can leave empty, input a location name that is ambiguous or has typos, or a string that does not match with any specific locations (e.g., â€œat homeâ€). Looking at users' self-reported locations, Hecht et al. BIBREF49 found that 66% report information that can be translated, accurately or inaccurately, to a geographic location, with the other 34% being either empty or not geolocalisable.

User language (ulang): This is the user's self-declared user interface language. The interface language might be indicative of the user's country of origin; however, they might also have set up the interface in a different language, such as English, because it was the default language when they signed up or because the language of their choice is not available.

Timezone (tz): This indicates the time zone that the user has specified in their settings, e.g., â€œPacific Time (US & Canada)â€. When the user has specified an accurate time zone in their settings, it can be indicative of their country of origin; however, some users may have the default time zone in their settings, or they may use an equivalent time zone belonging to a different location (e.g., â€œEurope/Londonâ€ for a user in Portugal). Also, Twitter's list of time zones does not include all countries.

Tweet language (tlang): The language in which a tweet is believed to be written is automatically detected by Twitter. It has been found to be accurate for major languages, but it leaves much to be desired for less widely used languages. Twitter's language identifier has also been found to struggle with multilingual tweets, where parts of a tweet are written in different languages BIBREF50 .

Offset (offset): This is the offset, with respect to UTC/GMT, that the user has specified in their settings. It is similar to the time zone, albeit more limited as it is shared with a number of countries.

User name (name): This is the name that the user specifies in their settings, which can be their real name, or an alternative name they choose to use. The name of a user can reveal, in some cases, their country of origin.

User description (description): This is a free text where a user can describe themselves, their interests, etc.

Tweet content (content): The text that forms the actual content of the tweet. The use of content has a number of caveats. One is that content might change over time, and therefore new tweets might discuss new topics that the classifiers have not seen before. Another caveat is that the content of the tweet might not be location-specific; in a previous study, Rakesh et al. BIBREF51 found that the content of only 289 out of 10,000 tweets was location-specific. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Learning Explicit and Implicit Structures for Targeted Sentiment Analysis, Which model is used to capture the implicit structure? [/INST] No, The three yellow boxes in Figure FIGREF14 compute scores for rich implicit structures from the neural architecture consisting of LSTM and self-attention.
Given an input token sequence $\mathbf {x}=\lbrace x_1,x_2,\cdots ,x_{n}\rbrace $ of length $n$, we first compute the concatenated embedding $\mathbf {e}_k=[\mathbf {w}_k;\mathbf {c}_k]$ based on word embedding $\mathbf {w}_k$ and character embedding $\mathbf {c}_k$ at position $k$.
As illustrated on the left part in Figure FIGREF14, we then use a Bi-directional LSTM to encode context features and obtain hidden states $\mathbf {h}_k=\mathrm {BiLSTM}(\mathbf {e_1},\mathbf {e_2}, \cdots , \mathbf {e_n})$. We use two different linear layers $f_t$ and $f_s$ to compute scores for target and sentiment respectively. The linear layer $f_t$ returns a vector of length 4, with each value in the vector indicating the score of the corresponding tag under the BMES tagging scheme. The linear layer $f_s$ returns a vector of length 3, with each value representing the score of a certain polarity of $+,0,-$. We assign such scores to each type of edge as follows:
As illustrated in Figure FIGREF14, we calculate $\mathbf {a}_k$, the output of self-attention at position $k$:

where $\alpha _{k,j}$ is the normalized weight score for $\mathbf {\beta }_{k,j}$, and $\mathbf {\beta }_{k,j}$ is the weight score calculated by target representation at position $k$ and contextual representation at position $j$. In addition, $W$ and $b$ as well as the attention matrix $U$ are the weights to be learned. Such a vector $\mathbf {a}_k$ encodes the implicit structures between the word $x_k$ and each word in the remaining sentence. </s>

Questions are only kept if a Wikipedia page is returned as one of the first five results, in which case the question and Wikipedia page are given to a human annotator for further processing.

Annotators label question/article pairs in a three-step process. First, they decide if the question is good, meaning it is comprehensible, unambiguous, and requesting factual information. This judgment is made before the annotator sees the Wikipedia page. Next, for good questions, annotators find a passage within the document that contains enough information to answer the question. Annotators can mark questions as â€œnot answerable" if the Wikipedia article does not contain the requested information. Finally, annotators mark whether the question's answer is â€œyes" or â€œno".

There are different kinds of possible noise namely non-canonical text such as spelling mistakes, typographic errors, colloquialisms, abbreviations, slang, internet jargon, emojis, embedded metadata (such as hashtags, URLs, mentions), non standard syntactic constructions and spelling variations, grammatically incorrect text, mixture of two or more languages to name a few.

<s>[INST] In the paper User Generated Data: Achilles' heel of BERT, What is the reason behind the drop in performance using BERT for some popular task?

WordPiece tokenizer utterances based on the longest prefix matching algorithm to generate tokens . The tokens thus obtained are fed as input of the BERT model.
When it comes to tokenizing noisy data, we see a very interesting behaviour from WordPiece tokenizer. Owing to the spelling mistakes, these words are not directly found in BERTâ€™s dictionary. Hence WordPiece tokenizer tokenizes noisy words into subwords. However, it ends up breaking them into subwords whose meaning can be very different from the meaning of the original word. Often, this changes the meaning of the sentence completely, therefore leading to substantial dip in the performance. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Compressing BERT: Studying the Effects of Weight Pruning on Transfer Learning, How they observe that fine-tuning BERT on a specific task does not improve its prunability? [/INST] The main questions this paper attempts to answer are: Does compressing BERT impede it's ability to transfer to new tasks? And does fine-tuning make BERT more or less compressible?

To explore these questions, we compressed English BERT using magnitude weight pruning BIBREF8 and observed the results on transfer learning to the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark BIBREF9, a diverse set of natural language understanding tasks including sentiment analysis, NLI, and textual similarity evaluation. We chose magnitude weight pruning, which compresses models by removing weights close to 0, because it is one of the most fine-grained and effective compression methods and because there are many interesting ways to view pruning, which we explore in the next section.
Our findings are as follows: Low levels of pruning (30-40%) do not increase pre-training loss or affect transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper DP-LSTM: Differential Privacy-inspired LSTM for Stock Prediction Using Financial News, How does the differential privacy mechanism work? [/INST] Therefore, in order to enhance the prediction model's robustness, we will adopt differential privacy (DP) method. DP is a system for sharing information about a dataset publicly by describing groups' patterns within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset. DP can be achieved if the we are willing to add random noise to the result. For example, rather than simply reporting the sum, we can inject noise from a Laplace or gaussian distribution, producing a result thatâ€™s not quite exact, that masks the contents of any given row.
 It intuitively requires that the mechanism that outputs information about an underlying dataset is robust to one sample's any change, thus protecting privacy. A mechanism ${f}$ is a random function that takes a dataset $\mathcal {N}$ as input, and outputs a random variable ${f}(\mathcal {N})$. For example, suppose $\mathcal {N}$ is a news articles dataset, then the function that outputs compound score of articles in $\mathcal {N}$ plus noise from the standard normal distribution is a mechanism [7]. </s>

However, after a predetermined number of child models, $m$ , have been evaluated, a hurdle, $h_0$ , is created by calculating the the mean fitness of the current population. For the next $m$ child models produced, models that achieve a fitness greater than $h_0$ after $s_0$ train steps are granted an additional $s_1$ steps of training and then are evaluated again to determine their final fitness. Once another $m$ models have been considered this way, another hurdle, $h_1$ , is constructed by calculating the mean fitness of all members of the current population that were trained for the maximum number of steps. For the next $m$ child models, training and evaluation continues in the same fashion, except models with fitness greater than $m$0 after $m$1 steps of training are granted an additional $m$2 number of train steps, before being evaluated for their final fitness.

<s>[INST] In the paper MonaLog: a Lightweight System for Natural Language Inference Based on Monotonicity, How do they combine MonaLog with BERT?

Since our logic operates over surface forms, it is straightforward to hybridize our models. We investigate using MonaLog in combination with the language model BERT BIBREF20, including for compositional data augmentation, i.e, re-generating entailed versions of examples in our training sets. 
We perform two experiments to test MonaLog.

Second, we test the quality of the data generated by MonaLog. To do this, we generate more training data (sentence pairs) from the SICK training data using our system, and performe fine-tuning on BERT BIBREF20, a language model based on the transformer architecture BIBREF23, with the expanded dataset.  </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper MonaLog: a Lightweight System for Natural Language Inference Based on Monotonicity, How do they select monotonicity facts? [/INST] MonaLog utilizes two auxiliary sets. First, a knowledge base ${K}$ that stores the world knowledge needed for inference, e.g., semanticist $\le $ linguist and swim $\le $ move, which captures the facts that $[\![\mbox{\em semanticist}]\!]$ denotes a subset of $[\![\mbox{\em linguist}]\!]$, and that $[\![\mbox{\em swim}]\!]$ denotes a subset of $[\![\mbox{\em move}]\!]$, respectively. Such world knowledge can be created manually for the problem at hand, or derived easily from existing resources such as WordNet BIBREF22. Note that we do not blindly add all relations from WordNet to our knowledge base, since this would hinge heavily on word sense disambiguation (we need to know whether the â€œbankâ€ is a financial institution or a river bank to extract its relations correctly). In the current implementation, we avoid this by adding x $\le $ y or x $\perp $ y relations only if both x and y are words in the premise-hypothesis pair. Additionally, some relations that involve quantifiers and prepositions need to be hard-coded, since WordNet does not include them: every $=$ all $=$ each $\le $ most $\le $ many $\le $ a few $=$ several $\le $ some $=$ a; the $\le $ some $=$ a; on $\perp $ off; up $\perp $ down; etc. </s>

[/INST] Given a set of evaluation documents, each having a known correct label from a closed set of labels (often referred to as the â€œgold-standardâ€), and a predicted label for each document from the same set, the document-level accuracy is the proportion of documents that are correctly labeled over the entire evaluation collection. This is the most frequently reported metric and conveys the same information as the error rate, which is simply the proportion of documents that are incorrectly labeled (i.e. INLINEFORM0 ).
There are two distinct ways in which results are generally summarized per-language: (1) precision, in which documents are grouped according to their predicted language; and (2) recall, in which documents are grouped according to what language they are actually written in.
It is also common practice to report an F-score INLINEFORM0 , which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. </s>

TextCat is the most well-known Perl implementation of the out-of-place method, it lists models for 76 languages in its off-the-shelf configuration; the program is not actively maintained. TextCat is not the only example of an off-the-shelf implementation of the out-of-place method: other implementations include libtextcat with 76 language models, JTCL with 15 languages, and mguesser with 104 models for different language-encoding pairs. The main issue addressed by later implementations is classification speed: TextCat is implemented in Perl and is not optimized for speed, whereas implementations such as libtextcat and mguesser have been specifically written to be fast and efficient. whatlang-rs uses an algorithm based on character trigrams and refers the user to the BIBREF7 article. It comes pre-trained with 83 languages.

is the language identifier embedded in the Google Chrome web browser. It uses a NB classifier, and script-specific classification strategies. assumes that all the input is in UTF-8, and assigns the responsibility of encoding detection and transcoding to the user. uses Unicode information to determine the script of the input. also implements a number of pre-processing heuristics to help boost performance on its target domain (web pages), such as stripping character sequences like .jpg. The standard implementation supports 83 languages, and an extended model is also available, that supports 160 languages.

is a Java library that implements a language identifier based on a NB classifier trained over character . The software comes with pre-trained models for 53 languages, using data from Wikipedia. makes use of a range of normalization heuristics to improve the performance on particular languages, including: (1) clustering of Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters to reduce sparseness; (2) removal of â€œlanguage-independentâ€ characters, and other text normalization; and (3) normalization of Arabic characters.

is a Python implementation of the method described by BIBREF150 , which exploits training data for the same language across multiple different sources of text to identify sequences of characters that are strongly predictive of a given language, regardless of the source of the text. This feature set is combined with a NB classifier, and is distributed with a pre-trained model for 97 languages prepared using data from 5 different text sources. BIBREF151 provide an empirical comparison of to , and and find that it compares favorably both in terms of accuracy and classification speed. There are also implementations of the classifier component (but not the training portion) of in Java, C, and JavaScript.

BIBREF153 uses a vector-space model with per-feature weighting on character sequences. One particular feature of is that it uses discriminative training in selecting features, i.e. it specifically makes use of features that are strong evidence against a particular language, which is generally not captured by NB models. Another feature of is that it uses inter-string smoothing to exploit sentence-level locality in making language predictions, under the assumption that adjacent sentences are likely to be in the same language. BIBREF153 reports that this substantially improves the accuracy of the identifier. Another distinguishing feature of is that it comes pre-trained with data for 1400 languages, which is the highest number by a large margin of any off-the-shelf system.

whatthelang is a recent language identifier written in Python, which utilizes the FastText NN-based text classification algorithm. It supports 176 languages.

implements an off-the-shelf classifier trained using Wikipedia data, covering 122 languages. Although not described as such, the actual classification algorithm used is a linear model, and is thus closely related to both NB and a cosine-based vector space model.

In addition to the above-mentioned general-purpose language identifiers, there have also been efforts to produce pre-trained language identifiers targeted specifically at Twitter messages. is a Twitter-specific tool with built-in models for 19 languages. It uses a document representation based on tries BIBREF401 . The algorithm is a LR classifier using all possible substrings of the data, which is important to maximize the available information from the relatively short Twitter messages.

BIBREF152 provides a comparison of 8 off-the-shelf language identifiers applied without re-training to Twitter messages. One issue they report is that comparing the accuracy of off-the-shelf systems is difficult because of the different subset of languages supported by each system, which may also not fully cover the languages present in the target data. The authors choose to compare accuracy over the full set of languages, arguing that this best reflects the likely use-case of applying an off-the-shelf system to new data. They find that the best individual systems are , and , but that slightly higher accuracy can be attained by a simple voting-based ensemble classifier involving these three systems.

In addition to this, commercial or other closed-source language identifiers and language identifier services exist, of which we name a few. The Polyglot 3000 and Lextek Language Identifier are standalone language identifiers for Windows. Open Xerox Language Identifier is a web service with available REST and SOAP APIs. </s>

A final softmax output predicts the 7 subword targets, obtained from the same forced alignment process described in SECREF5 . This results in the baseline DNN containing 1.7M parameters, and performing 1.8M multiply-accumulate operations per inference (every 30ms of streaming audio). A keyword spotting score between 0 and 1 is computed by first smoothing the posterior values, averaging them over a sliding window of the previous 100 frames with respect to the current INLINEFORM3 ; the score is then defined as the largest product of the smoothed posteriors in the sliding window as originally proposed in BIBREF6 . </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Monitoring stance towards vaccination in twitter messages, What is the agreement score of their annotated dataset? [/INST] We calculated inter-annotator agreement by Krippendorff's Alpha BIBREF23, which accounts for different annotator pairs and empty values. To also zoom in on the particular agreement by category, we calculated mutual F-scores for each of the categories. This metric is typically used to evaluate system performance by category on gold standard data, but could also be applied to annotation pairs by alternating the roles of the two annotators between classifier and ground truth.
While both the Relevance and Subject categorizations are annotated at a percent agreement of $0.71$ and $0.70$, their agreement scores are only fair, at $\alpha =0.27$ and $\alpha =0.29$. The percent agreement on Stance and Sentiment, which carry more categories than the former two, is $0.54$ for both. Their agreement scores are also fair, at $\alpha =0.35$ and $\alpha =0.34$. The mutual F-scores show marked differences in agreement by category, where the categories that were annotated most often typically yield a higher score. This holds for the Relevant category ($0.81$), the Vaccine category ($0.79$) and the Positive category ($0.64$). The Negative category yields a mutual F-score of $0.42$, which is higher than the more frequently annotated categories Neutral ($0.23$) and Not clear ($0.31$). We found that these categories are often confused. After combining the annotations of the two, the stance agreement would be increased to $\alpha =0.43$. </s>

Based on our investigation of several previous studies, we found that most of the works utilized ISO 9241 to assess chatbots' quality by focusing on the usability aspect. This aspect can be grouped into three focuses, including efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction, concerning systems' performance to achieve the specified goals.
In automatic evaluation, some studies focus on evaluating the system at emotion level BIBREF15 , BIBREF28 . Therefore, some common metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy are used to measure system performance, compared to the gold label. This evaluation is similar to emotion classification tasks such as previous SemEval 2018 BIBREF32 and SemEval 2019 . Other studies also proposed to use perplexity to evaluate the model at the content level (to determine whether the content is relevant and grammatical) BIBREF14 , BIBREF39 , BIBREF28 . This evaluation metric is widely used to evaluate dialogue-based systems which rely on probabilistic approach BIBREF61 . Another work by BIBREF14 used BLEU to evaluate the machine response and compare against the gold response (the actual response), although using BLEU to measure conversation generation task is not recommended by BIBREF62 due to its low correlation with human judgment.
This evaluation involves human judgement to measure the chatbots' performance, based on several criteria. BIBREF15 used three annotators to rate chatbots' response in two criteria, content (scale 0,1,2) and emotion (scale 0,1).

<s>[INST] In the paper Feature-Dependent Confusion Matrices for Low-Resource NER Labeling with Noisy Labels, What is baseline used? [/INST]  The Base is trained only on clean data while Base+Noise is trained on both the clean and the noisy data without noise handling. Global-CM uses a global confusion matrix for all noisy instances to model the noise as proposed by BIBREF3 and presented in Section SECREF3. The same architecture is used for Global-ID-CM, but the confusion matrix is initialized with the identity matrix (instead of Formula DISPLAY_FORM5) and only adapted during training.

The cluster-based models we propose in Section SECREF4 are Brown-CM and K-Means-CM. We experimented with numbers of clusters of 5, 10, 25 and 50. The models that select only the largest groups $G$ are marked as *-Freq and select either 30% or 50% of the clusters. The interpolation models have the postfix *-IP with $\lambda \in \lbrace 0.3, 0.5, 0.7\rbrace $ . The combination of both is named *-Freq-IP. As for all other hyperparameters, the choice was taken on the development set.

We implemented the Cleaning BIBREF15 and Dynamic-CM BIBREF14 models. Both were not developed for sequence labeling tasks and therefore needed to be adapted. For the Cleaning model, we followed the instructions by BIBREF3. The embedding and prediction components of the Dynamic-CM model were replaced according to our base model.

<s>[INST] In the paper BLiMP: A Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs for English, How is the data automatically generated? [/INST] To create minimal pairs exemplifying a wide array of linguistic contrasts, it is necessary to artificially generate all datasets. This ensures both that we have sufficient unacceptable examples, and that the data is fully controlled, allowing for repeated isolation of a single linguistic phenomenon in each paradigm BIBREF30. The data generation scripts use a basic template to create each paradigm, pulling from a vocabulary of over 3000 words annotated for morphological, syntactic, and semantic features needed to create grammatical and semantically felicitous sentences. Examples SECREF6 and SECREF6 show one such template for the `acceptable' and `unacceptable' sentences within a pair: the sole difference between them is the underlined word, which differs only in whether the anaphor agrees in number with its antecedent. Our generation codebase and scripts are freely available.
This generation procedure is not without limitations, and despite the very detailed vocabulary we use, implausible sentences are occasionally generated (e.g., `Sam ran around some glaciers'). In these cases, though, both the acceptable and unacceptable sentences will be equally implausible given world knowledge, so any difference in the probability assigned to them is still due to the intended grammatical contrast. </s>

But the biggest drawback of these approaches is that the corpus for training embeddings can be not related to the specific task where embeddings are utilized.

<s>[INST] In the paper From 'F' to 'A' on the N.Y. Regents Science Exams: An Overview of the Aristo Project, Is Aristo just some modern NLP model (ex. BERT) finetuned od data specific for this task? [/INST] The current configuration of Aristo comprises of eight solvers, described shortly, each of which attempts to answer a multiple choice question. To study particular phenomena and develop solvers, the project has created larger datasets to amplify and study different problems, resulting in 10 new datasets and 5 large knowledge resources for the community.

The solvers can be loosely grouped into:

Statistical and information retrieval methods

Reasoning methods

Large-scale language model methods
Over the life of the project, the relative importance of the methods has shifted towards large-scale language methods.
The field of NLP has advanced substantially with the advent of large-scale language models such as ELMo (BID6), ULMFit (BID37), GPT (BID38), BERT (BID7), and RoBERTa (BID8). These models are trained to perform various language prediction tasks such as predicting a missing word or the next sentence, using large amounts of text (e.g., BERT was trained on Wikipedia + the Google Book Corpus of 10,000 books). They can also be fine-tuned to new language prediction tasks, such as question-answering, and have been remarkably successful in the few months that they have been available.
We apply BERT to multiple choice questions by treating the task as classification: Given a question $q$ with answer options $a_{i}$ and optional background knowledge $K_{i}$, we provide it to BERT as:

[CLS] $K_i$ [SEP] $q$ [SEP] $a_{i}$ [SEP]
The AristoBERT solver uses three methods to apply BERT more effectively. First, we retrieve and supply background knowledge along with the question when using BERT. This provides the potential for BERT to â€œreadâ€ that background knowledge and apply it to the question, although the exact nature of how it uses background knowledge is more complex and less interpretable. Second, we fine-tune BERT using a curriculum of several datasets, including some that are not science related. Finally, we ensemble different variants of BERT together. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Attention Optimization for Abstractive Document Summarization, How do they define local variance? [/INST] Drawing on the concept of variance in mathematics, local variance loss is defined as the reciprocal of its variance expecting the attention model to be able to focus on more salient parts. The standard variance calculation is based on the mean of the distribution. However, as previous work BIBREF15, BIBREF16 mentioned that the median value is more robust to outliers than the mean value, we use the median value to calculate the variance of the attention distribution. Thus, local variance loss can be calculated as:

where $\hat{\cdot }$ is a median operator and $\epsilon $ is utilized to avoid zero in the denominator. </s>

We therefore apply simple regular expressions to remove these prefixes.

Second, to ensure that the summary is concise and the article contains enough salient information, we only keep articles with 10-150 words in the top three sentences and 150-1200 words in the rest, and that contain at least 6 sentences in total. In this way, we filter out i) articles with excessively long content to reduce memory consumption; ii) very short leading sentences with little information which are unlikely to be a good summary. To encourage the model to generate abstrative summaries, we also remove articles where any of the top three sentences is exactly repeated in the rest of the article.

Third, we try to remove articles whose top three sentences may not form a relevant summary. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Learning Rare Word Representations using Semantic Bridging, What other embedding models are tested? [/INST] In our experiments, we used WordNet 3.0 BIBREF9 as our external knowledge base INLINEFORM0 . For word embeddings, we experimented with two popular models: (1) GloVe embeddings trained by BIBREF10 on Wikipedia and Gigaword 5 (vocab: 400K, dim: 300), and (2) w2v-gn, Word2vec BIBREF5 trained on the Google News dataset (vocab: 3M, dim: 300).
Our coverage enhancement starts by transforming the knowledge base INLINEFORM0 into a vector space representation that is comparable to that of the corpus-based space INLINEFORM1 . To this end, we use two techniques for learning low-dimensional feature spaces from knowledge graphs: DeepWalk and node2vec. DeepWalk uses a stream of short random walks in order to extract local information for a node from the graph. By treating these walks as short sentences and phrases in a special language, the approach learns latent representations for each node. Similarly, node2vec learns a mapping of nodes to continuous vectors that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. Thanks to a flexible objective that is not tied to a particular sampling strategy, node2vec reports improvements over DeepWalk on multiple classification and link prediction datasets. For both these systems we used the default parameters and set the dimensionality of output representation to 100. Also, note than nodes in the semantic graph of WordNet represent synsets. Hence, a polysemous word would correspond to multiple nodes. In our experiments, we use the MaxSim assumption of BIBREF11 in order to map words to synsets. </s>

We evaluated whether the names of places were properly learned for the considered teaching places. This experiment assumes a request for the best phoneme sequence INLINEFORM0 representing the self-position INLINEFORM1 for a robot. The robot moves close to each teaching place. The probability of a word INLINEFORM2 when the self-position INLINEFORM3 of the robot is given, INLINEFORM4 , can be obtained by using equation ( EQREF37 ). The word having the best probability was selected. We compared the PAR with the correct phoneme sequence and a selected name of the place. Because â€œkiqchiNâ€ and â€œdaidokoroâ€ were taught for the same place, the word whose PAR was the higher score was adopted.

Fig. FIGREF63 shows the results of PAR for the word considered the name of a place. SpCoA (latticelm), the proposed method using the results of unsupervised word segmentation on the basis of the speech recognition results in the lattice format, showed the best PAR score. In the 1-best and BoS methods, a part syllable sequence of the name of a place was more minutely segmented as shown in Table TABREF55 . Therefore, the robot could not learn the name of the teaching place as a coherent phoneme sequence.

<s>[INST] In the paper Self-Attentional Models Application in Task-Oriented Dialogue Generation Systems, Is human evaluation performed? [/INST] BLEU: We use the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) BIBREF34 metric which is commonly used in machine translation tasks. The BLEU metric can be used to evaluate dialogue generation models as in BIBREF5, BIBREF35. The BLEU metric is a word-overlap metric which computes the co-occurrence of N-grams in the reference and the generated response and also applies the brevity penalty which tries to penalize far too short responses which are usually not desired in task-oriented chatbots. We compute the BLEU score using all generated responses of our systems.

Per-turn Accuracy: Per-turn accuracy measures the similarity of the system generated response versus the target response. Eric and Manning eric2017copy used this metric to evaluate their systems in which they considered their response to be correct if all tokens in the system generated response matched the corresponding token in the target response. This metric is a little bit harsh, and the results may be low since all the tokens in the generated response have to be exactly in the same position as in the target response.

Per-Dialogue Accuracy: We calculate per-dialogue accuracy as used in BIBREF8, BIBREF5. For this metric, we consider all the system generated responses and compare them to the target responses. A dialogue is considered to be true if all the turns in the system generated responses match the corresponding turns in the target responses. Note that this is a very strict metric in which all the utterances in the dialogue should be the same as the target and in the right order.

F1-Entity Score: Datasets used in task-oriented chores have a set of entities which represent user preferences. For example, in the restaurant domain chatbots common entities are meal, restaurant name, date, time and the number of people (these are usually the required entities which are crucial for making reservations, but there could be optional entities such as location or rating). Each target response has a set of entities which the system asks or informs the user about. Our models have to be able to discern these specific entities and inject them into the generated response. To evaluate our models we could use named-entity recognition evaluation metrics BIBREF36. The F1 score is the most commonly used metric used for the evaluation of named-entity recognition models which is the harmonic average of precision and recall of the model. We calculate this metric by micro-averaging over all the system generated responses. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Fully Automated Fact Checking Using External Sources, How are the potentially relevant text fragments identified? [/INST] This step consists of generating a query out of the claim and querying a search engine (here, we experiment with Google and Bing) in order to retrieve supporting documents. Rather than querying the search engine with the full claim (as on average, a claim is two sentences long), we generate a shorter query following the lessons highlighted in BIBREF0 .
We rank the words by means of tf-idf. We compute the idf values on a 2015 Wikipedia dump and the English Gigaword. BIBREF0 suggested that a good way to perform high-quality search is to only consider the verbs, the nouns and the adjectives in the claim; thus, we exclude all words in the claim that belong to other parts of speech. Moreover, claims often contain named entities (e.g., names of persons, locations, and organizations); hence, we augment the initial query with all the named entities from the claim's text. We use IBM's AlchemyAPI to identify named entities. Ultimately, we generate queries of 5â€“10 tokens, which we execute against a search engine.

<s>[INST] In the paper Utilizing BERT for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Constructing Auxiliary Sentence, How do they generate the auxiliary sentence? [/INST] Construction of the auxiliary sentence
For simplicity, we mainly describe our method with TABSA as an example.

We consider the following four methods to convert the TABSA task into a sentence pair classification task:

The sentence we want to generate from the target-aspect pair is a question, and the format needs to be the same. For example, for the set of a target-aspect pair (LOCATION1, safety), the sentence we generate is â€œwhat do you think of the safety of location - 1 ?"

For the NLI task, the conditions we set when generating sentences are less strict, and the form is much simpler. The sentence created at this time is not a standard sentence, but a simple pseudo-sentence, with (LOCATION1, safety) pair as an example: the auxiliary sentence is: â€œlocation - 1 - safety".

For QA-B, we add the label information and temporarily convert TABSA into a binary classification problem ( INLINEFORM0 ) to obtain the probability distribution. At this time, each target-aspect pair will generate three sequences such as â€œthe polarity of the aspect safety of location - 1 is positive", â€œthe polarity of the aspect safety of location - 1 is negative", â€œthe polarity of the aspect safety of location - 1 is none". We use the probability value of INLINEFORM1 as the matching score. For a target-aspect pair which generates three sequences ( INLINEFORM2 ), we take the class of the sequence with the highest matching score for the predicted category.

The difference between NLI-B and QA-B is that the auxiliary sentence changes from a question to a pseudo-sentence. The auxiliary sentences are: â€œlocation - 1 - safety - positive", â€œlocation - 1 - safety - negative", and â€œlocation - 1 - safety - none".

After we construct the auxiliary sentence, we can transform the TABSA task from a single sentence classification task to a sentence pair classification task. As shown in Table TABREF19 , this is a necessary operation that can significantly improve the experimental results of the TABSA task. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Exploiting Invertible Decoders for Unsupervised Sentence Representation Learning, What are the two decoding functions? [/INST] In this case, the decoding function is a linear projection, which is $= f_{\text{de}}()=+ $ , where $\in ^{d_\times d_}$ is a trainable weight matrix and $\in ^{d_\times 1}$ is the bias term.
A family of bijective transformation was designed in NICE BIBREF17 , and the simplest continuous bijective function $f:^D\rightarrow ^D$ and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is defined as:

$$h: \hspace{14.22636pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2+m(_1) \nonumber \\ h^{-1}: \hspace{14.22636pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2-m(_1) \nonumber $$ (Eq. 15)

where $_1$ is a $d$ -dimensional partition of the input $\in ^D$ , and $m:^d\rightarrow ^{D-d}$ is an arbitrary continuous function, which could be a trainable multi-layer feedforward neural network with non-linear activation functions. It is named as an `additive coupling layer' BIBREF17 , which has unit Jacobian determinant. To allow the learning system to explore more powerful transformation, we follow the design of the `affine coupling layer' BIBREF24 :

$$h: \hspace{5.69046pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= _2 \odot \text{exp}(s(_1)) + t(_1) \nonumber \\ h^{-1}: \hspace{5.69046pt} _1 &= _1, & _2 &= (_2-t(_1)) \odot \text{exp}(-s(_1)) \nonumber $$ (Eq. 16)

where $s:^d\rightarrow ^{D-d}$ and $t:^d\rightarrow ^{D-d}$ are both neural networks with linear output units.

The requirement of the continuous bijective transformation is that, the dimensionality of the input $$ and the output $$ need to match exactly. </s>

SumBasic, which uses word frequency to rank sentences and selects top sentences as the summary BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 .
Lsa, which uses latent semantic analysis (LSA) to decompose the term-by-sentence matrix of a document and extracts sentences based on the result. We experimented with the two approaches proposed in BIBREF15 and BIBREF16 respectively.
LexRank, which constructs a graph representation of a document, where nodes are sentences and edges represent similarity between two sentences, and runs PageRank algorithm on that graph and extracts sentences based on the resulting PageRank values BIBREF17 .
TextRank, which is very similar to LexRank but computes sentence similarity based on the number of common tokens BIBREF19 .
Bayes, which represents each sentence as a feature vector and uses naive Bayes to classify them BIBREF5 . The original paper computes TF-IDF score on multi-word tokens that are identified automatically using mutual information. We did not do this identification, so our TF-IDF computation operates on word tokens.
Hmm, which uses hidden Markov model where states correspond to whether the sentence should be extracted BIBREF20 . The original work uses QR decomposition for sentence selection but our implementation does not. We simply ranked the sentences by their scores and picked the top 3 as the summary.
MaxEnt, which represents each sentence as a feature vector and leverages maximum entropy model to compute the probability of a sentence should be extracted BIBREF21 . The original approach puts a prior distribution over the labels but we put the prior on the weights instead. Our implementation still agrees with the original because we employed a bias feature which should be able to learn the prior label distribution.
As for the neural supervised method, we evaluated NeuralSum BIBREF11 using the original implementation by the authors. We modified their implementation slightly to allow for evaluating the model with ROUGE. Note that all the methods are extractive.

<s>[INST] In the paper KryptoOracle: A Real-Time Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Platform Using Twitter Sentiments, How is the architecture fault-tolerant?

Data structures in Spark are based on resilient distributed datasets (RDD), a read only multi-set of data which can be distributed over a cluster of machines and is fault tolerant. 
Spark RDD has the innate capability to recover itself because it stores all execution steps in a lineage graph. In case of any faults in the system, Spark redoes all the previous executions from the built DAG and recovers itself to the previous steady state from any fault such as memory overload. Spark RDDs lie in the core of KryptoOracle and therefore make it easier for it to recover from faults. Moreover, faults like memory overload or system crashes may require for the whole system to hard reboot. However, due to the duplicate copies of the RDDs in Apache Hive and the stored previous state of the machine learning model, KryptoOracle can easily recover to the previous steady state.

[/INST] In particular, we perform an extensive set of experiments on standard benchmarks for bilingual dictionary induction and monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, as well as on an extrinsic task: cross-lingual hypernym discovery.
For both the monolingual and cross-lingual settings, we can notice that our models generally outperform the corresponding baselines. 
As can be seen in Table 1 , our refinement method consistently improves over the baselines (i.e., VecMap and MUSE) on all language pairs and metrics.
First and foremost, in terms of model-wise comparisons, we observe that our proposed alterations of both VecMap and MUSE improve their quality in a consistent manner, across most metrics and data configurations. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Improving Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings by Meeting in the Middle, Why does the model improve in monolingual spaces as well?  [/INST] We found interesting patterns which are learned by our model and help understand these monolingual gains. For example, a recurring pattern is that words in English which are translated to the same word, or to semantically close words, in the target language end up closer together after our transformation. For example, in the case of English-Spanish the following pairs were among the pairs whose similarity increased the most by applying our transformation: cellphone-telephone, movie-film, book-manuscript or rhythm-cadence, which are either translated to the same word in Spanish (i.e., telÃ©fono and pelÃ­cula in the first two cases) or are already very close in the Spanish space.
More generally, we found that word pairs which move together the most tend to be semantically very similar and belong to the same domain, e.g., car-bicycle, opera-cinema, or snow-ice.

As illustrated by our French actor example, a person's name can be a useful prior for guessing their native language and by extension, their nationality, place of birth, etc. Our person name filter uses cloze-style questions to elicit name associations inherent in BERT, and deletes KB triples that correlate with them. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Concurrent Parsing of Constituency and Dependency, How is dependency parsing empirically verified? [/INST] We evaluate our model on two benchmark treebanks, English Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Penn Treebank (CTB5.1) following standard data splitting BIBREF30, BIBREF31. POS tags are predicted by the Stanford Tagger BIBREF32. For constituent parsing, we use the standard evalb tool to evaluate the F1 score. For dependency parsing, we apply Stanford basic dependencies (SD) representation BIBREF4 converted by the Stanford parser. Following previous work BIBREF27, BIBREF33, we report the results without punctuations for both treebanks.

On PTB, our model achieves 93.90 F1 score of constituent parsing and 95.91 UAS and 93.86 LAS of dependency parsing. On CTB, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art result on both constituent and dependency parsing.

<s>[INST] In the paper Concurrent Parsing of Constituency and Dependency, How are different network components evaluated? [/INST] Shared Self-attention Layers As our model providing two outputs from one input, there is a bifurcation setting for how much shared part should be determined. Both constituent and dependency parsers share token representation and 8 self-attention layers at most. Assuming that either parser always takes input information flow through 8 self-attention layers as shown in Figure FIGREF4, then the number of shared self-attention layers varying from 0 to 8 may reflect the shared degree in the model. When the number is set to 0, it indicates only token representation is shared for both parsers trained for the joint loss through each own 8 self-attention layers. When the number is set to less than 8, for example, 6, then it means that both parsers first shared 6 layers from token representation then have individual 2 self-attention layers.
For different numbers of shared layers, the results are in Table TABREF14. We respectively disable the constituent and the dependency parser to obtain a separate learning setting for both parsers in our model. The comparison in Table TABREF14 indicates that even though without any shared self-attention layers, joint training of our model may significantly outperform separate learning mode. At last, the best performance is still obtained from sharing full 8 self-attention layers. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Customized Image Narrative Generation via Interactive Visual Question Generation and Answering, What are the features of used to customize target user interaction?  [/INST] We represent each instance of image, question, and user choice as a triplet consisting of image feature, question feature, and the label vector for the user's answer. In addition, collecting multiple choices from identical users enables us to represent any two instances by the same user as a pair of triplets, assuming source-target relation. With these pairs of triplets, we can train the system to predict a user's choice on a new image and a new question, given the same user's choice on the previous image and its associated question.
As discussed earlier, we attempt to reflect user's interest by asking questions that provide visual context.
In other words, a question whose answer is so obvious that it can be answered in an identical way would not be valid as an interactive question. 
 If the most likely candidate $c_i=\max p_{ans}$ , where $c_i \in C$ , has a probability of being answer over a certain threshold $\alpha $ , then the question is considered to have a single obvious answer, and is thus considered ineligible. 
In our experiments, we set $\alpha $ as 0.33. We also excluded the yes/no type of questions.  </s>

In addition to the automatic metrics, we proceeded to a human evaluation. We chose to use the data from our SQuAD-based experiments in order to also to measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach to derive Curiosity-driven QG data from a standard, non-conversational, QA dataset. We randomly sampled 50 samples from the test set. Three professional English speakers were asked to evaluate the questions generated by: humans (i.e. the reference questions), and models trained using pre-training (PT) or (RL), and all combinations of those methods.

Before submitting the samples for human evaluation, the questions were shuffled. Ratings were collected on a 1-to-5 likert scale, to measure to what extent the generated questions were: answerable by looking at their context; grammatically correct; how much external knowledge is required to answer; relevant to their context; and, semantically sound. The results of the human evaluation are reported in Table TABREF33. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Ask to Learn: A Study on Curiosity-driven Question Generation, What automated metrics authors investigate?

In particular, BLEU-N is based on the count of overlapping n-grams between the candidate and its corresponding reference(s).
Therefore, we adopt Self-BLEU, originally proposed by BIBREF33, as a measure of diversity for the generated text sequences. 
Therefore, given a question-context pair as input to a QA model, two type of metrics can be computed:

n-gram based score: measuring the average overlap between the retrieved answer and the ground truth.

probability score: the confidence of the QA model for its retrieved answer; this corresponds to the probability of being the correct answer assigned by the QA model to the retrieved answer. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Combining Acoustics, Content and Interaction Features to Find Hot Spots in Meetings, What they use as a metric of finding hot spots in meeting? [/INST] In spite of the windowing approach, the class distribution is still skewed, and an accuracy metric would reflect the particular class distribution in our data set. Therefore, we adopt the unweighted average recall (UAR) metric commonly used in emotion classification research. UAR is a reweighted accuracy where the samples of both classes are weighted equally in aggregate. UAR thus simulates a uniform class distribution. To match the objective, our classifiers are trained on appropriately weighted training data. Note that chance performance for UAR is by definition 50%, making results more comparable across different data sets. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper DpgMedia2019: A Dutch News Dataset for Partisanship Detection, What limitations are mentioned? [/INST] We identified some limitations during the process, which we describe in this section.

When deciding publisher partisanship, the number of people from whom we computed the score was small. For example, de Stentor is estimated to reach 275K readers each day on its official website. Deciding the audience leaning from 55 samples was subject to sampling bias. Besides, the scores differ very little between publishers. None of the publishers had an absolute score higher than 1, meaning that even the most partisan publisher was only slightly partisan. Deciding which publishers we consider as partisan and which not is thus not very reliable.

The article-level annotation task was not as well-defined as on a crowdsourcing platform. We included the questions as part of an existing survey and didn't want to create much burden to the annotators. Therefore, we did not provide long descriptive text that explained how a person should annotate an article. We thus run under the risk of annotator bias. This is one of the reasons for a low inter-rater agreement. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper DpgMedia2019: A Dutch News Dataset for Partisanship Detection, What examples of applications are mentioned? [/INST] This dataset is aimed to contribute to developing a partisan news detector. There are several ways that the dataset can be used to devise the system. For example, it is possible to train the detector using publisher-level labels and test with article-level labels. It is also possible to use semi-supervised learning and treat the publisher-level part as unsupervised, or use only the article-level part. We also released the raw survey data so that new mechanisms to decide the article-level labels can be devised. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper DpgMedia2019: A Dutch News Dataset for Partisanship Detection, Did they crowdsource the annotations? [/INST] To collect article-level labels, we utilized a platform in the company that has been used by the market research team to collect surveys from the subscribers of different news publishers. The survey works as follows: The user is first presented with a set of selected pages (usually 4 pages and around 20 articles) from the print paper the day before. The user can select an article each time that he or she has read, and answer some questions about it. We added 3 questions to the existing survey that asked the level of partisanship, the polarity of partisanship, and which pro- or anti- entities the article presents. We also asked the political standpoint of the user. The complete survey can be found in Appendices. </s>

Although statistical side information would be straightforward to incorporate in the hypothesis testing framework, it remains to understand how to cast such semantic knowledge in a statistical decision theory framework. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Limits of Detecting Text Generated by Large-Scale Language Models, Which language models generate text that can be easier to classify as genuine or generated? [/INST] Suppose we are given a specific language model such as GPT-2 BIBREF6, GROVER BIBREF8, or CTRL BIBREF7, and it is characterized in terms of estimates of either cross-entropy $H(P,Q)$ or perplexity $\mathrm {PPL}(P,Q)$.

We can see directly that the Neyman-Pearson error of detection in the case of i.i.d. tokens is:

and similar results hold for ergodic observations.

Since we think of $H(P)$ as a constant, we observe that the error exponent for the decision problem is precisely an affine shift of the cross-entropy. Outputs from models that are better in the sense of cross-entropy or perplexity are harder to distinguish from authentic text.

Thus we see that intuitive measures of generative text quality match a formal operational measure of indistinguishability that comes from the hypothesis testing limit. </s>

Moreover, given the diversity of language production, we assume this stationary ergodic random process with finite alphabet $\mathcal {A}$ denoted $X = \lbrace X_i, -\infty < i < \infty \rbrace $ is non-null in the sense that always $P(x_{-m}^{-1}) > 0$ and

Our proposed method comprises of two steps: a neighbourhood reconstruction step (Section "Nearest Neighbour Reconstruction" ), and a projection step (Section "Projection to Meta-Embedding Space" ).

 To test our proposed category induction model, we consider all BabelNet categories with fewer than 50 known instances. This is motivated by the view that conceptual neighborhood is mostly useful in cases where the number of known instances is small. For each of these categories, we split the set of known instances into 90% for training and 10% for testing. To tune the prior probability $\lambda _A$ for these categories, we hold out 10% from the training set as a validation set. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Modelling Semantic Categories using Conceptual Neighborhood, How they indentify conceptual neighbours?

To train such a classifier, we use the distant supervision labels from Section SECREF8 as training data. Once this classifier has been trained, we can then use it to predict conceptual neighborhood for categories for which only few instances are known.
To find sentences in which both $A$ and $B$ are mentioned, we rely on a disambiguated text corpus in which mentions of BabelNet categories are explicitly tagged. Such a disambiguated corpus can be automatically constructed, using methods such as the one proposed by BIBREF30 mancini-etal-2017-embedding, for instance. For each pair of candidate categories, we thus retrieve all sentences where they co-occur. Next, we represent each extracted sentence as a vector.  </s>

Our standard setup, which we use for fine-tuning, ensembling etc., is fixed to 6-6-6 for $N_{src}$-$N_{mt}$-$N_{pe}$ (cf. Figure FIGREF1), where 6 is the value that was proposed by Vaswani:NIPS2017 for the base model. We investigate what happens in terms of APE performance if we change this setting to 6-6-4 and 6-4-6. 
The number of layers ($N_{src}$-$N_{mt}$-$N_{pe}$) in all encoders and the decoder for these results is fixed to 6-6-6. In Exp. 5.1, and 5.2 in Table TABREF5, we see the results of changing this setting to 6-6-4 and 6-4-6. This can be compared to the results of Exp. 2.3, since no fine-tuning or ensembling was performed for these three experiments. Exp. 5.1 shows that decreasing the number of layers on the decoder side does not hurt the performance. In fact, in the case of test2016, we got some improvement, while for test2017, the scores got slightly worse. In contrast, reducing the $enc_{src \rightarrow mt}$ encoder block's depth (Exp. 5.2) does indeed reduce the performance for all four scores, showing the importance of this second encoder.; (Â±X) value is the improvement over wmt18smtbest (x4). The last section of the table shows the impact of increasing and decreasing the depth of the encoders and the decoder. </s>

Zoph and Knight BIBREF20 propose a multi-source model and BIBREF21 introduces a character-level encoder that is shared across several source languages. In our setup, we will follow the main idea proposed by Johnson et al. BIBREF22 . The authors of that paper suggest a simple addition by means of a language flag on the source language side (see Figure 2 ) to indicate the target language that needs to be produced by the decoder. This flag will be mapped on a dense vector representation and can be used to trigger the generation of the selected language. The authors of the paper argue that the model enables transfer learning and supports the translation between languages that are not explicitly available in training. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Speakers account for asymmetries in visual perspective so listeners don't have to, Did participants behave unexpectedly? [/INST] Experiment 1 directly tested the hypothesis that speakers increase their specificity in contexts with asymmetry in visual access. We found that speakers are not only context-sensitive in choosing referring expressions that distinguish target from distractors in a shared context, but are occlusion-sensitive, adaptively compensating for uncertainty.
These results strongly suggest that the speaker's informativity influences listener accuracy. In support of this hypothesis, we found a strong negative correlation between informativity and error rates across items and conditions: listeners make fewer errors when utterances are a better fit for the target relative to the distractor ( $\rho = -0.81$ , bootstrapped 95% CI $= [-0.9, -0.7]$ ; Fig. 6 B). This result suggests that listener behavior is driven by an expectation of speaker informativity: listeners interpret utterances proportionally to how well they fit objects in context.
Our Rational Speech Act (RSA) formalization of cooperative reasoning in this context predicts that speakers (directors) naturally increase the informativity of their referring expressions to hedge against the increased risk of misunderstanding; Exp. 1 presents direct evidence in support of this hypothesis.
Exp. 2 is consistent with this hypothesis; when directors used underinformative scripted instructions (taken from prior work), listeners made significantly more errors than when speakers were allowed to provide referring expressions at their natural level of informativity, and speaker informativeness strongly modulated listener error rates. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Question Answering and Question Generation as Dual Tasks, What does "explicitly leverages their probabilistic correlation to guide the training process of both models" mean? [/INST] Moreover, QA and QG have probabilistic correlation as both tasks relate to the joint probability between $q$ and $a$ . Given a question-answer pair $\langle q, a \rangle $ , the joint probability $P(q, a)$ can be computed in two equivalent ways.

$$P(q, a) = P(a) P(q|a) = P(q)P(a|q)$$ (Eq. 1)

The conditional distribution $P(q|a)$ is exactly the QG model, and the conditional distribution $P(a|q)$ is closely related to the QA model. Existing studies typically learn the QA model and the QG model separately by minimizing their own loss functions, while ignoring the probabilistic correlation between them.

Based on these considerations, we introduce a training framework that exploits the duality of QA and QG to improve both tasks. There might be different ways of exploiting the duality of QA and QG. In this work, we leverage the probabilistic correlation between QA and QG as the regularization term to influence the training process of both tasks. Specifically, the training objective of our framework is to jointly learn the QA model parameterized by $\theta _{qa}$ and the QG model parameterized by $\theta _{qg}$ by minimizing their loss functions subject to the following constraint.

$$P_a(a) P(q|a;\theta _{qg}) = P_q(q)P(a|q;\theta _{qa})$$ (Eq. 3)

$P_a(a)$ and $P_q(q)$ are the language models for answer sentences and question sentences, respectively.
Overall, the framework includes three components, namely a QA model, a QG model and a regularization term that reflects the duality of QA and QG.
The QA specific objective aims to minimize the loss function $l_{qa}(f_{qa}(a,q;\theta _{qa}), label)$ , where $label$ is 0 or 1 that indicates whether $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ or not.
For each correct question-answer pair, the QG specific objective is to minimize the following loss function,

$$l_{qg}(q, a) = -log P_{qg}(q|a;\theta _{qg})$$ (Eq. 6)

where $a$ is the correct answer of $q$ .
The third objective is the regularization term which satisfies the probabilistic duality constrains as given in Equation 3 . Specifically, given a correct $\langle q, a \rangle $ pair, we would like to minimize the following loss function,

$$ \nonumber l_{dual}(a,q;\theta _{qa}, \theta _{qg}) &= [logP_a(a) + log P(q|a;\theta _{qg}) \\ & - logP_q(q) - logP(a|q;\theta _{qa})]^2$$ (Eq. 9)

where $P_a(a)$ and $P_q(q)$ are marginal distributions, which could be easily obtained through language model. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper BiSET: Bi-directional Selective Encoding with Template for Abstractive Summarization, How are templates discovered from training data?

Then, the Fast Rerank module quickly identifies a best template from the candidates. Finally, BiSET mutually selects important information from the source article and the template to generate an enhanced article representation for summarization.
This module starts with a standard information retrieval library to retrieve a small set of candidates for fine-grained filtering as cao2018retrieve. To do that, all non-alphabetic characters (e.g., dates) are removed to eliminate their influence on article matching. The retrieval process starts by querying the training corpus with a source article to find a few (5 to 30) related articles, the summaries of which will be treated as candidate templates.
The above retrieval process is essentially based on superficial word matching and cannot measure the deep semantic relationship between two articles. Therefore, the Fast Rerank module is developed to identify a best template from the candidates based on their deep semantic relevance with the source article. We regard the candidate with highest relevance as the template. As illustrated in Figure FIGREF6 , this module consists of a Convolution Encoder Block, a Similarity Matrix and a Pooling Layer. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Neural Network Translation Models for Grammatical Error Correction, Do they use pretrained word representations in their neural network models? [/INST] Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a challenging task due to the variability of the type of errors and the syntactic and semantic dependencies of the errors on the surrounding context. Most of the grammatical error correction systems use classification and rule-based approaches for correcting specific error types. However, these systems use several linguistic cues as features. The standard linguistic analysis tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers and parsers are often trained on well-formed text and perform poorly on ungrammatical text. This introduces further errors and limits the performance of rule-based and classification approaches to GEC. As a consequence, the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC has gained popularity because of its ability to learn text transformations from erroneous text to correct text from error-corrected parallel corpora without any additional linguistic information. 
We model our GEC system based on the phrase-based SMT approach. However, traditional phrase-based SMT systems treat words and phrases as discrete entities. We take advantage of continuous space representation by adding two neural network components that have been shown to improve SMT systems BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 .
To train NNJM, we use the publicly available implementation, Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) BIBREF14 . The latest version of Moses can incorporate NNJM trained using NPLM as a feature while decoding.

We select a source context vocabulary of 16,000 most frequent words from the source side. The target context vocabulary and output vocabulary is set to the 32,000 most frequent words. We use a single hidden layer to speed up training and decoding with an input embedding dimension of 192 and 512 hidden layer nodes.  </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure, Was any variation in results observed based on language typology? [/INST] On another note, we apply our formalization to evaluate multilingual $\textsc {bert} $'s syntax knowledge on a set of six typologically diverse languages. Although it does encode a large amount of information about syntax (more than $81\%$ in all languages), it only encodes at most $5\%$ more information than some trivial baseline knowledge (a type-level representation). This indicates that the task of POS labeling (word-level POS tagging) is not an ideal task for contemplating the syntactic understanding of contextual word embeddings.
We see thatâ€”in all analysed languagesâ€”type level embeddings can already capture most of the uncertainty in POS tagging. We also see that BERT only shares a small amount of extra information with the task, having small (or even negative) gains in all languages.
Finally, when put into perspective, multilingual $\textsc {bert} $'s representations do not seem to encode much more information about syntax than a trivial baseline. $\textsc {bert} $ only improves upon fastText in three of the six analysed languagesâ€”and even in those, it encodes at most (in English) $5\%$ additional information. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Progressive Joint Modeling in Unsupervised Single-channel Overlapped Speech Recognition, How is the discriminative training formulation different from the standard ones? [/INST] For the overlapped speech recognition problem, the conditional independence assumption in the output label streams is still made as in Equation ( 5 ). Then the cross-entropy based PIT can be transformed to sequence discriminative criterion based PIT as below,

$$\begin{split} \mathcal {J}_{\text{SEQ-PIT}}=\sum _u \min _{s^{\prime }\in \mathbf {S}} \frac{1}{N} \sum _{n\in [1,N]}-\mathcal {J}_{\text{SEQ}}(\mathbf {L}_{un}^{(s^{\prime })},\mathbf {L}_{un}^{(r)}) \end{split}$$ (Eq. 44)

Different from Equation ( 7 ), the best permutation is decided by $\mathcal {J}_{\text{SEQ}}(\mathbf {L}_{un}^{(s^{\prime })},\mathbf {L}_{un}^{(r)})$ , which is the sequence discriminative criterion of taking the $s^{\prime }$ -th permutation in $n$ -th output inference stream at utterance $u$ . Similar to CE-PIT, $\mathcal {J}_{\text{SEQ}}$ of all the permutations are calculated and the minimum permutation is taken to do the optimization. </s>

Firstly, we employ 300-dimensional pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe BIBREF29 to compute a tweet embedding as the average of the embeddings of words in the tweet.
Secondly, we apply the latent semantic indexing BIBREF30 to capture the underlying semantics of the dataset. Here, each tweet is represented as a vector of 100 dimensions.
Thirdly, we also extract tweet representation by applying the Brown clustering algorithm BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 â€”a hierarchical clustering algorithm which groups the words with similar meaning and syntactical function together.
Motivated by the verbal irony by means of polarity contrast, such as â€œI really love this year's summer; weeks and weeks of awful weatherâ€, we use the number of polarity signals appearing in a tweet as the polarity features. The signals include positive words (e.g., love), negative words (e.g., awful), positive emoji icon and negative emoji icon. We use the sentiment dictionaries provided by BIBREF33 to identify positive and negative words in a tweet.

<s>[INST] In the paper HuggingFace's Transformers: State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing, What state-of-the-art general-purpose pretrained models are made available under the unified API?  [/INST] Here is a list of architectures for which reference implementations and pretrained weights are currently provided in Transformers. These models fall into two main categories: generative models (GPT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, XLNet, XLM) and models for language understanding (Bert, DistilBert, RoBERTa, XLM).

BERT (BIBREF13) is a bi-directional Transformer-based encoder pretrained with a linear combination of masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives.

RoBERTa (BIBREF5) is a replication study of BERT which showed that carefully tuning hyper-parameters and training data size lead to significantly improved results on language understanding.

DistilBERT (BIBREF32) is a smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter version BERT pretrained with knowledge distillation.

GPT (BIBREF34) and GPT2 (BIBREF9) are two large auto-regressive language models pretrained with language modeling. GPT2 showcased zero-shot task transfer capabilities on various tasks such as machine translation or reading comprehension.

Transformer-XL (BIBREF35) introduces architectural modifications enabling Transformers to learn dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence via segment-level recurrence and relative positional encoding schemes.

XLNet (BIBREF4) builds upon Transformer-XL and proposes an auto-regressive pretraining scheme combining BERT's bi-directional context flow with auto-regressive language modeling by maximizing the expected likelihood over permutations of the word sequence.

XLM (BIBREF8) shows the effectiveness of pretrained representations for cross-lingual language modeling (both on monolingual data and parallel data) and cross-lingual language understanding.

We systematically release the model with the corresponding pretraining heads (language modeling, next sentence prediction for BERT) for adaptation using the pretraining objectives. Some models fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as SQuAD1.1 are also available. Overall, more than 30 pretrained weights are provided through the library including more than 10 models pretrained in languages other than English. Some of these non-English pretrained models are multi-lingual models (with two of them being trained on more than 100 languages) . </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper A framework for streamlined statistical prediction using topic models, How is performance measured? [/INST] To assess the predictive capability of this and other models, we require some method by which we can compare the models. For that purpose, we use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as a visual representation of predictive effectiveness. ROC curves compare the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of a model's predictions at different threshold levels. The area under the curve (AUC) (between 0 and 1) is a numerical measure, where the higher the AUC is, the better the model performs.
We cross-validate our model by first randomly splitting the corpus into a training set (95% of the corpus) and test set (5% of the corpus). We then fit the model to the training set, and use it to predict the response of the documents in the test set. We repeat this process 100 times. The threshold-averaged ROC curve BIBREF13 is found from these predictions, and shown in Figure 3 . Table 1 shows the AUC for each model considered. </s>

(ii) Embedding selection dataset: As the evaluation was carried out only on the newscaster speaking style, we restrict our linguistic search space to the utterances associated to the newscaster style: 3000 sentences.

Experimental Protocol ::: Datasets ::: Evaluation Dataset
The systems were evaluated on two datasets:

(i) Common Prosody Errors (CPE): The dataset on which the baseline Prostron model fails to generate appropriate prosody. This dataset consists of complex utterances like compound nouns (22%), â€œor" questions (9%), â€œwh" questions (18%). This set is further enhanced by sourcing complex utterances (51%) from BIBREF24.

(ii) LFR: As demonstrated in BIBREF25, evaluating sentences in isolation does not suffice if we want to evaluate the quality of long-form speech.

<s>[INST] In the paper Unsupervised, Knowledge-Free, and Interpretable Word Sense Disambiguation, Do they use a neural model for their task?

This model uses the cluster words from the induced word sense inventory as sparse features that represent the sense.

Word senses based on context word features. This representation is based on a sum of word vectors of all cluster words in the induced sense inventory weighted by distributional similarity scores.

Super senses based on cluster word features. To build this model, induced word senses are first globally clustered using the Chinese Whispers graph clustering algorithm BIBREF9 . The edges in this sense graph are established by disambiguation of the related words BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . The resulting clusters represent semantic classes grouping words sharing a common hypernym, e.g. â€œanimalâ€. This set of semantic classes is used as an automatically learned inventory of super senses: There is only one global sense inventory shared among all words in contrast to the two previous traditional â€œper wordâ€ models. Each semantic class is labeled with hypernyms. This model uses words belonging to the semantic class as features.

Super senses based on context word features. This model relies on the same semantic classes as the previous one but, instead, sense representations are obtained by averaging vectors of words sharing the same class. </s>

Standard convolutional networks cannot capture long temporal patterns with reasonably small models due to the increase in computational cost yielded by larger receptive fields. Dilated convolutions skip some input values so that the convolution kernel is applied over a larger area than its own. The network therefore operates on a larger scale, without the downside of increasing the number of parameters. </s>

spaCy is a widely used NLP library that implements state-of-the-art text processing pipelines, including a sequence-labelling pipeline similar to the one described by strubell2017fast. spaCy offers several pre-trained models in Spanish, which perform basic NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). In this paper, we have trained a new NER model to detect NUBes-PHI labels.
As the simplest baseline, a sensitive data recogniser and classifier has been developed that consists of regular-expressions and dictionary look-ups. For each category to detect a specific method has been implemented. For instance, the Date, Age, Time and Doctor detectors are based on regular-expressions; Hospital, Sex, Kinship, Location, Patient and Job are looked up in dictionaries. The dictionaries are hand-crafted from the training data available, except for the Patient's case, for which the possible candidates considered are the 100 most common female and male names in Spain according to the Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica (INE; Spanish Statistical Office). </s>

However, attending to the obtained results, BERT remains only 0.3 F1-score points behind, and would have achieved the second position among all the MEDDOCAN shared task competitors. Taking into account that only 3% of the gold labels remain incorrectly annotated, the task can be considered almost solved, and it is not clear if the differences among the systems are actually significant, or whether they stem from minor variations in initialisation or a long-tail of minor labelling inconsistencies. </s>

The numbers in Table TABREF22 are striking: there seems to be a real, systematic difference in ethnicity marking between the groups. We can take one step further and look at all the 697 pictures with the word `baby' in it. If there turn out to be disproportionately many white babies, this strengthens the conclusion that the dataset is biased. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper What Does My QA Model Know? Devising Controlled Probes using Expert Knowledge, Are the automatically constructed datasets subject to quality control? [/INST] Dataset Probes and Construction
Our probing methodology starts by constructing challenge datasets (Figure FIGREF1, yellow box) from a target set of knowledge resources. Each of our probing datasets consists of multiple-choice questions that include a question $\textbf {q}$ and a set of answer choices or candidates $\lbrace a_{1},...a_{N}\rbrace $. This section describes in detail the 5 different datasets we build, which are drawn from two sources of expert knowledge, namely WordNet BIBREF35 and the GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English (GCIDE). We describe each resource in turn, and explain how the resulting dataset probes, which we call WordNetQA and DictionaryQA, are constructed.

For convenience, we will describe each source of expert knowledge as a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. The nodes of this graph are $\mathcal {V} = \mathcal {C} \cup \mathcal {W} \cup \mathcal {S} \cup \mathcal {D}$, where $\mathcal {C}$ is a set of atomic concepts, $\mathcal {W}$ a set of words, $\mathcal {S}$ a set of sentences, and $\mathcal {D}$ a set of definitions (see Table TABREF4 for details for WordNet and GCIDE). Each edge of $G$ is directed from an atomic concept in $\mathcal {C}$ to another node in $V$, and is labeled with a relation, such as hypernym or isa$^\uparrow $, from a set of relations $\mathcal {R}$ (see Table TABREF4).

When defining our probe question templates, it will be useful to view $G$ as a set of (relation, source, target) triples $\mathcal {T} \subseteq \mathcal {R} \times \mathcal {C} \times \mathcal {V}$. Due to their origin in an expert knowledge source, such triples preserve semantic consistency. For instance, when the relation in a triple is def, the corresponding edge maps a concept in $\mathcal {C}$ to a definition in $\mathcal {D}$.

To construct probe datasets, we rely on two heuristic functions, defined below for each individual probe: $\textsc {gen}_{\mathcal {Q}}(\tau )$, which generates gold question-answer pairs $(\textbf {q},\textbf {a})$ from a set of triples $\tau \subseteq \mathcal {T}$ and question templates $\mathcal {Q}$, and $\textsc {distr}(\tau ^{\prime })$, which generates distractor answers choices $\lbrace a^{\prime }_{1},...a^{\prime }_{N-1} \rbrace $ based on another set of triples $\tau ^{\prime }$ (where usually $\tau \subset \tau ^{\prime }$). For brevity, we will use $\textsc {gen}(\tau )$ to denote $\textsc {gen}_{\mathcal {Q}}(\tau )$, leaving question templates $\mathcal {Q}$ implicit.

Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA
WordNet is an English lexical database consisting of around 117k concepts, which are organized into groups of synsets that each contain a gloss (i.e., a definition of the target concept), a set of representative English words (called lemmas), and, in around 33k synsets, example sentences. In addition, many synsets have ISA links to other synsets that express complex taxonomic relations. Figure FIGREF6 shows an example and Table TABREF4 summarizes how we formulate WordNet as a set of triples $\mathcal {T}$ of various types. These triples together represent a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. Our main motivation for using WordNet, as opposed to a resource such as ConceptNet BIBREF36, is the availability of glosses ($\mathcal {D}$) and example sentences ($\mathcal {S}$), which allows us to construct natural language questions that contextualize the types of concepts we want to probe.

Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Example Generation @!START@$\textsc {gen}(\tau )$@!END@.
We build 4 individual datasets based on semantic relations native to WordNet (see BIBREF37): hypernymy (i.e., generalization or ISA reasoning up a taxonomy, ISA$^\uparrow $), hyponymy (ISA$^{\downarrow }$), synonymy, and definitions. To generate a set of questions in each case, we employ a number of rule templates $\mathcal {Q}$ that operate over tuples. A subset of such templates is shown in Table TABREF8. The templates were designed to mimic naturalistic questions we observed in our science benchmarks.

For example, suppose we wish to create a question $\textbf {q}$ about the definition of a target concept $c \in \mathcal {C}$. We first select a question template from $\mathcal {Q}$ that first introduces the concept $c$ and its lemma $l \in \mathcal {W}$ in context using the example sentence $s \in \mathcal {S}$, and then asks to identify the corresponding WordNet gloss $d \in \mathcal {D}$, which serves as the gold answer $\textbf {a}$. The same is done for ISA reasoning; each question about a hypernym/hyponym relation between two concepts $c \rightarrow ^{\uparrow /\downarrow } c^{\prime } \in \mathcal {T}_{i}$ (e.g., $\texttt {dog} \rightarrow ^{\uparrow /\downarrow } \texttt {animal/terrier}$) first introduces a context for $c$ and then asks for an answer that identifies $c^{\prime }$ (which is also provided with a gloss so as to contain all available context).

In the latter case, the rules $(\texttt {isa}^{r},c,c^{\prime }) \in \mathcal {T}_i$ in Table TABREF8 cover only direct ISA links from $c$ in direction $r \in \lbrace \uparrow ,\downarrow \rbrace $. In practice, for each $c$ and direction $r$, we construct tests that cover the set HOPS$(c,r)$ of all direct as well as derived ISA relations of $c$:

This allows us to evaluate the extent to which models are able to handle complex forms of reasoning that require several inferential steps or hops.

Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Distractor Generation: @!START@$\textsc {distr}(\tau ^{\prime })$@!END@.
An example of how distractors are generated is shown in Figure FIGREF6, which relies on similar principles as above. For each concept $c$, we choose 4 distractor answers that are close in the WordNet semantic space. For example, when constructing hypernymy tests for $c$ from the set hops$(c,\uparrow )$, we build distractors by drawing from $\textsc {hops}(c,\downarrow )$ (and vice versa), as well as from the $\ell $-deep sister family of $c$, defined as follows. The 1-deep sister family is simply $c$'s siblings or sisters, i.e., the other children $\tilde{c} \ne c$ of the parent node $c^{\prime }$ of $c$. For $\ell > 1$, the $\ell $-deep sister family also includes all descendants of each $\tilde{c}$ up to $\ell -1$ levels deep, denoted $\textsc {hops}_{\ell -1}(\tilde{c},\downarrow )$. Formally:

For definitions and synonyms we build distractors from all of these sets (with a similar restriction on the depth of sister distractors as noted above). In doing this, we can systematically investigate model performance on a wide range of distractor sets.

Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Perturbations and Semantic Clusters
Based on how we generate data, for each concept $c$ (i.e., atomic WordNet synset) and probe type (i.e., definitions, hypernymy, etc.), we have a wide variety of questions related to $c$ that manipulate 1) the complexity of reasoning that is involved (e.g., the number of inferential hops) and; 2) the types of distractors (or distractor perturbations) that are employed. We call such sets semantic clusters. As we describe in the next section, semantic clusters allow us to devise new types of evaluation that reveal whether models have comprehensive and consistent knowledge of target concepts (e.g., evaluating whether a model can correctly answer several questions associated with a concept, as opposed to a few disjoint instances).

Details of the individual datasets are shown in Table TABREF12. From these sets, we follow BIBREF22 in allocating a maximum of 3k examples for training and reserve the rest for development and testing. Since we are interested in probing, having large held-out sets allows us to do detailed analysis and cluster-based evaluation.

Dataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA
The DictionaryQA dataset is created from the GCIDE dictionary, which is a comprehensive open-source English dictionary built largely from the Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary BIBREF38. Each entry consists of a word, its part-of-speech, its definition, and an optional example sentence (see Table TABREF14). Overall, 33k entries (out of a total of 155k) contain example sentences/usages. As with the WordNet probes, we focus on this subset so as to contextualize each word being probed. In contrast to WordNet, GCIDE does not have ISA relations or explicit synsets, so we take each unique entry to be a distinct sense. We then use the dictionary entries to create a probe that centers around word-sense disambiguation, as described below.

Dataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA ::: Example and Distractor Generation.
To generate gold questions and answers, we use the same generation templates for definitions exemplified in Figure TABREF8 for WordNetQA. To generate distractors, we simply take alternative definitions for the target words that represent a different word sense (e.g., the alternative definitions of gift shown in Table TABREF14), as well as randomly chosen definitions if needed to create a 5-way multiple choice question. As above, we reserve a maximum of 3k examples for training. Since we have only 9k examples in total in this dataset (see WordSense in Table TABREF12), we also reserve 3k each for development and testing.

We note that initial attempts to build this dataset through standard random splitting gave rise to certain systematic biases that were exploited by the choice-only baseline models described in the next section, and hence inflated overall model scores. After several efforts at filtering we found that, among other factors, using definitions from entries without example sentences as distractors (e.g., the first two entries in Table TABREF14) had a surprising correlation with such biases. This suggests that possible biases involving differences between dictionary entries with and without examples can taint the resulting automatically generated MCQA dataset (for more discussion on the pitfalls involved with automatic dataset construction, see Section SECREF5). </s>

(3) NaiveNN: This is a non-domain-adaptive CNN trained on source domain, which is a variant of our model by setting INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 to zeros.

(4) AuxNN BIBREF4 : This is a neural model that exploits auxiliary tasks, which has achieved state-of-the-art results on cross-domain sentiment classification. The sentence encoder used in this model is the same as ours.

<s>[INST] In the paper Active Learning for Speech Recognition: the Power of Gradients, How do they calculate variance from the model outputs? [/INST] Since labels are unknown on INLINEFORM1 , EGL computes the expectation of the gradient norm over all possible labelings. BIBREF3 interprets EGL as â€œexpected model changeâ€. In the following section, we formalize the intuition for EGL and show that it follows naturally from reducing the variance of an estimator.
Eq. ( EQREF7 ) indicates that to reduce INLINEFORM0 on test data, we need to minimize the expected variance INLINEFORM1 over the test set.
A practical issue is that we do not know INLINEFORM0 in advance. We could instead substitute an estimate INLINEFORM1 from a pre-trained model, where it is reasonable to assume the INLINEFORM2 to be close to the true INLINEFORM3 . The batch selection then works by taking the samples that have largest gradient norms, DISPLAYFORM0

For RNNs, the gradients for each potential label can be obtained by back-propagation. Another practical issue is that EGL marginalizes over all possible labelings, but in speech recognition, the number of labelings scales exponentially in the number of timesteps. Therefore, we only marginalize over the INLINEFORM0 most probable labelings. They are obtained by beam search decoding, as in BIBREF7 . The EGL method in BIBREF3 is almost the same as Eq. ( EQREF8 ), except the gradient's norm is not squared in BIBREF3 . </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Dice Loss for Data-imbalanced NLP Tasks, How are weights dynamically adjusted? [/INST] Comparing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 with Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22, we can see that Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 is actually a soft form of $F1$, using a continuous $p$ rather than the binary $\mathbb {I}( p_{i1}>0.5)$. This gap isn't a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easy-negative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabilities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard-negative examples and positive ones, which has a huge negative effect on the final F1 performance.

To address this issue, we propose to multiply the soft probability $p$ with a decaying factor $(1-p)$, changing Eq.DISPLAY_FORM22 to the following form:

One can think $(1-p_{i1})$ as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing $p_{i1}$ to $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1, $(1-p_{i1}) p_{i1}$ makes the model attach significantly less focus to them. Figure FIGREF23 gives gives an explanation from the perspective in derivative: the derivative of $\frac{(1-p)p}{1+(1-p)p}$ with respect to $p$ approaches 0 immediately after $p$ approaches 0, which means the model attends less to examples once they are correctly classified.

A close look at Eq.DISPLAY_FORM14 reveals that it actually mimics the idea of focal loss (FL for short) BIBREF16 for object detection in vision. Focal loss was proposed for one-stage object detector to handle foreground-background tradeoff encountered during training. It down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples by adding a $(1-p)^{\beta }$ factor, leading the final loss to be $(1-p)^{\beta }\log p$. </s>

Propaganda Techniques ::: 1. Loaded language.
Using words/phrases with strong emotional implications (positive or negative) to influence an audience BIBREF11.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 2. Name calling or labeling.
Labeling the object of the propaganda as something the target audience fears, hates, finds undesirable or otherwise loves or praises BIBREF12.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 3. Repetition.
Repeating the same message over and over again, so that the audience will eventually accept it BIBREF13, BIBREF12.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 4. Exaggeration or minimization.
Either representing something in an excessive manner: making things larger, better, worse, or making something seem less important or smaller than it actually is BIBREF14, e.g., saying that an insult was just a joke.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 5. Doubt.
Questioning the credibility of someone or something.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 6. Appeal to fear/prejudice.
Seeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative, possibly based on preconceived judgments.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 7. Flag-waving.
Playing on strong national feeling (or with respect to a group, e.g., race, gender, political preference) to justify or promote an action or idea BIBREF15.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 8. Causal oversimplification.
Assuming one cause when there are multiple causes behind an issue. We include scapegoating as well: the transfer of the blame to one person or group of people without investigating the complexities of an issue.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 9. Slogans.
A brief and striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping. Slogans tend to act as emotional appeals BIBREF16.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 10. Appeal to authority.
Stating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority/expert on the issue supports it, without any other supporting evidence BIBREF17. We include the special case where the reference is not an authority/expert, although it is referred to as testimonial in the literature BIBREF14.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 11. Black-and-white fallacy, dictatorship.
Presenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist BIBREF13. As an extreme case, telling the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choice (dictatorship).

Propaganda Techniques ::: 12. Thought-terminating clichÃ©.
Words or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic. They are typically short and generic sentences that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought BIBREF18.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 13. Whataboutism.
Discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly disproving their argument BIBREF19.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 14. Reductio ad Hitlerum.
Persuading an audience to disapprove an action or idea by suggesting that the idea is popular with groups hated in contempt by the target audience. It can refer to any person or concept with a negative connotation BIBREF20.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 15. Red herring.
Introducing irrelevant material to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points made BIBREF11. Those subjected to a red herring argument are led away from the issue that had been the focus of the discussion and urged to follow an observation or claim that may be associated with the original claim, but is not highly relevant to the issue in dispute BIBREF20.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 16. Bandwagon.
Attempting to persuade the target audience to join in and take the course of action because â€œeveryone else is taking the same actionâ€ BIBREF15.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 17. Obfuscation, intentional vagueness, confusion.
Using deliberately unclear words, to let the audience have its own interpretation BIBREF21, BIBREF11. For instance, when an unclear phrase with multiple possible meanings is used within the argument and, therefore, it does not really support the conclusion.

Propaganda Techniques ::: 18. Straw man.
When an opponent's proposition is substituted with a similar one which is then refuted in place of the original BIBREF22. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper A Resource for Computational Experiments on Mapudungun, What are the models used for the baseline of the three NLP tasks? [/INST] Baseline Results ::: Speech Synthesis
In our previous work on building speech systems on found data in 700 languages, BIBREF7, we addressed alignment issues (when audio is not segmented into turn/sentence sized chunks) and correctness issues (when the audio does not match the transcription). We used the same techniques here, as described above.

For the best quality speech synthesis we need a few hours of phonetically-balanced, single-speaker, read speech. Our first step was to use the start and end points for each turn in the dialogues, and select those of the most frequent speaker, nmlch. This gave us around 18250 segments. We further automatically removed excessive silence from the start, middle and end of these turns (based on occurrence of F0). This gave us 13 hours and 48 minutes of speech.

We phonetically aligned this data and built a speech clustergen statistical speech synthesizer BIBREF9 from all of this data.

<s>[INST] In the paper Towards speech-to-text translation without speech recognition, what challenges are identified? [/INST] Analysis of challenges from UTD
Our system relies on the pseudotext produced by ZRTools (the only freely available UTD system we are aware of), which presents several challenges for MT. 
Assigning wrong words to a cluster
Since UTD is unsupervised, the discovered clusters are noisy. 
Splitting words across different clusters
Although most UTD matches are across speakers, recall of cross-speaker matches is lower than for same-speaker matches. As a result, the same word from different speakers often appears in multiple clusters, preventing the model from learning good translations.
UTD is sparse, giving low coverage
We found that the patterns discovered by ZRTools match only 28% of the audio. This low coverage reduces training data size, affects alignment quality, and adversely affects translation, which is only possible when pseudoterms are present. </s>

Pre-training baselines: We conduct three pre-training baseline experiments: 1) encoder pre-training, in which the ST encoder is initialized from an ASR model; 2) decoder pre-training, in which the ST decoder is initialized from an MT model; and 3) encoder-decoder pre-training, where both the encoder and decoder are pre-trained. The ASR model has the same architecture with vanilla ST model, trained on the mixture of ST-TED and TED-LIUM2 corpus. The MT model has a text encoder and decoder with the same architecture of which in TCEN. It is first trained on WMT data (out-of-domain) and then fine-tuned on in-domain data.

Multi-task baselines: We also conduct three multi-task baseline experiments including one-to-many setting, many-to-one setting, and many-to-many setting. In the first two settings, we train the model with $\alpha _{st}=0.75$ while $\alpha _{asr}=0.25$ or $\alpha _{mt}=0.25$.

<s>[INST] In the paper UTCNN: a Deep Learning Model of Stance Classificationon on Social Media Text, How many layers does the UTCNN model have? [/INST] Figure FIGREF10 illustrates the UTCNN model. As more than one user may interact with a given post, we first add a maximum pooling layer after the user matrix embedding layer and user vector embedding layer to form a moderator matrix embedding INLINEFORM0 and a moderator vector embedding INLINEFORM1 for moderator INLINEFORM2 respectively, where INLINEFORM3 is used for the semantic transformation in the document composition process, as mentioned in the previous section. The term moderator here is to denote the pseudo user who provides the overall semantic/sentiment of all the engaged users for one document. The embedding INLINEFORM4 models the moderator stance preference, that is, the pattern of the revealed user stance: whether a user is willing to show his preference, whether a user likes to show impartiality with neutral statements and reasonable arguments, or just wants to show strong support for one stance. Ideally, the latent user stance is modeled by INLINEFORM5 for each user. Likewise, for topic information, a maximum pooling layer is added after the topic matrix embedding layer and topic vector embedding layer to form a joint topic matrix embedding INLINEFORM6 and a joint topic vector embedding INLINEFORM7 for topic INLINEFORM8 respectively, where INLINEFORM9 models the semantic transformation of topic INLINEFORM10 as in users and INLINEFORM11 models the topic stance tendency. The latent topic stance is also modeled by INLINEFORM12 for each topic.

As for comments, we view them as short documents with authors only but without likers nor their own comments. Therefore we apply document composition on comments although here users are commenters (users who comment). It is noticed that the word embeddings INLINEFORM0 for the same word in the posts and comments are the same, but after being transformed to INLINEFORM1 in the document composition process shown in Figure FIGREF4 , they might become different because of their different engaged users. The output comment representation together with the commenter vector embedding INLINEFORM2 and topic vector embedding INLINEFORM3 are concatenated and a maximum pooling layer is added to select the most important feature for comments. Instead of requiring that the comment stance agree with the post, UTCNN simply extracts the most important features of the comment contents; they could be helpful, whether they show obvious agreement or disagreement. Therefore when combining comment information here, the maximum pooling layer is more appropriate than other pooling or merging layers. Indeed, we believe this is one reason for UTCNN's performance gains.

Finally, the pooled comment representation, together with user vector embedding INLINEFORM0 , topic vector embedding INLINEFORM1 , and document representation are fed to a fully connected network, and softmax is applied to yield the final stance label prediction for the post. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks, How are the siamese networks trained? [/INST] Model
SBERT adds a pooling operation to the output of BERT / RoBERTa to derive a fixed sized sentence embedding. We experiment with three pooling strategies: Using the output of the CLS-token, computing the mean of all output vectors (MEAN-strategy), and computing a max-over-time of the output vectors (MAX-strategy). The default configuration is MEAN.

In order to fine-tune BERT / RoBERTa, we create siamese and triplet networks BIBREF15 to update the weights such that the produced sentence embeddings are semantically meaningful and can be compared with cosine-similarity.

The network structure depends on the available training data. We experiment with the following structures and objective functions.

Classification Objective Function. We concatenate the sentence embeddings $u$ and $v$ with the element-wise difference $|u-v|$ and multiply it with the trainable weight $W_t \in \mathbb {R}^{3n \times k}$:

where $n$ is the dimension of the sentence embeddings and $k$ the number of labels. We optimize cross-entropy loss. This structure is depicted in Figure FIGREF4.

Regression Objective Function. The cosine-similarity between the two sentence embeddings $u$ and $v$ is computed (Figure FIGREF5). We use mean-squared-error loss as the objective function.

Triplet Objective Function. Given an anchor sentence $a$, a positive sentence $p$, and a negative sentence $n$, triplet loss tunes the network such that the distance between $a$ and $p$ is smaller than the distance between $a$ and $n$. Mathematically, we minimize the following loss function:

with $s_x$ the sentence embedding for $a$/$n$/$p$, $||\cdot ||$ a distance metric and margin $\epsilon $. Margin $\epsilon $ ensures that $s_p$ is at least $\epsilon $ closer to $s_a$ than $s_n$. As metric we use Euclidean distance and we set $\epsilon =1$ in our experiments. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Macaw: An Extensible Conversational Information Seeking Platform, What functionality does Macaw provide? [/INST] Co-Reference Resolution: To support multi-turn interactions, it is sometimes necessary to use co-reference resolution techniques for effective retrieval. In Macaw, we identify all the co-references from the last request of user to the conversation history. The same co-reference resolution outputs can be used for different query generation components. This can be a generic or action-specific component.

Query Generation: This component generates a query based on the past user-system interactions. The query generation component may take advantage of co-reference resolution for query expansion or re-writing.

Retrieval Model: This is the core ranking component that retrieves documents or passages from a large collection. Macaw can retrieve documents from an arbitrary document collection using the Indri python interface BIBREF9, BIBREF10. We also provide the support for web search using the Bing Web Search API. Macaw also allows multi-stage document re-ranking.

Result Generation: The retrieved documents can be too long to be presented using some interfaces. Result generation is basically a post-processing step ran on the retrieved result list. In case of question answering, it can employ answer selection or generation techniques, such as machine reading comprehension models. For example, Macaw features the DrQA model BIBREF11 for question answering. </s>

Standard IO: This interactive command line interface is designed for development purposes to interact with the system, see the logs, and debug or improve the system.

Telegram: This interactive interface is designed for interaction with real users (see FIGREF4). Telegram is a popular instant messaging service whose client-side code is open-source. We have implemented a Telegram bot that can be used with different devices (personal computers, tablets, and mobile phones) and different operating systems (Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS, and Windows). This interface allows multi-modal interactions (text, speech, click, image). It can be also used for speech-only interactions. For speech recognition and generation, Macaw relies on online APIs, e.g., the services provided by Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. In addition, there exist multiple popular groups and channels in Telegram, which allows further integration of social networks with conversational systems. For example, see the Naseri and Zamani's study on news popularity in Telegram BIBREF12. </s>

Given an entity INLINEFORM0 and the already added news references INLINEFORM1 up to year INLINEFORM2 , the novelty of INLINEFORM3 at year INLINEFORM4 is measured by the KL divergence between the language model of INLINEFORM5 and articles in INLINEFORM6 .

LR + Bag-of-words: We aggregate the tweets of a feed and we use a bag-of-words representation with a logistic regression (LR) classifier.

Tweet2vec: We use the Bidirectional Gated recurrent neural network model proposed in BIBREF20. We keep the default parameters that were provided with the implementation. To represent the tweets, we use the decoded embedding produced by the model. With this baseline we aim at assessing if the tweets' hashtags may help detecting the non-factual accounts.

LR + All Features (tweet-level): We extract all our features from each tweet and feed them into a LR classifier. Here, we do not aggregate over tweets and thus view each tweet independently.

FacTweet (tweet-level): Similar to the FacTweet approach, but at tweet-level; the sequential flow of the tweets is not utilized. We aim at investigating the importance of the sequential flow of tweets.

Top-$k$ replies, likes, or re-tweets: Some approaches in rumors detection use the number of replies, likes, and re-tweets to detect rumors BIBREF21. Thus, we extract top $k$ replied, liked or re-tweeted tweets from each account to assess the accounts factuality. We tested different $k$ values between 10 tweets to the max number of tweets from each account. Figure FIGREF24 shows the macro-F1 values for different $k$ values.

Consequently, we investigate ways to detect suspicious accounts by considering their tweets in groups (chunks). Our hypothesis is that suspicious accounts have a unique pattern in posting tweet sequences. Since their intention is to mislead, the way they transition from one set of tweets to the next has a hidden signature, biased by their intentions.

Morality: Features based on morality foundation theory BIBREF16 where words are labeled in one of the following 10 categories (care, harm, fairness, cheating, loyalty, betrayal, authority, subversion, sanctity, and degradation).

As the figure shows, sports and politics are most dominant for offensive language including vulgar and hate speech. As for dialect, we looked at MSA and four major dialects, namely Egyptian (EGY), Leventine (LEV), Maghrebi (MGR), and Gulf (GLF). Figure FIGREF14 shows that 71% of vulgar tweets were written in EGY followed by GLF, which accounted for 13% of vulgar tweets. MSA was not used in any of the vulgar tweets.

Unlike the case of vulgar language where MSA was non-existent, 15% of the offensive tweets were in fact written in MSA.

[/INST] Multiple papers have shown that 'shallow' naive Bayes classifiers BIBREF12, BIBREF8, BIBREF13, BIBREF14, SVMs BIBREF15 and similar models work very well for doing LID.

The winning approach for DSL 2015 used an ensemble naive Bayes classifier. The fasttext classifier BIBREF17 is perhaps one of the best known efficient 'shallow' text classifiers that have been used for LID .

<s>[INST] In the paper Comparative Studies of Detecting Abusive Language on Twitter, Does the dataset feature only English language data? [/INST] Previously, datasets openly available in abusive language detection research on Twitter ranged from 10K to 35K in size BIBREF9 , BIBREF11 . This quantity is not sufficient to train the significant number of parameters in deep learning models. Due to this reason, these datasets have been mainly studied by traditional machine learning methods. Most recently, Founta et al. founta2018large introduced Hate and Abusive Speech on Twitter, a dataset containing 100K tweets with cross-validated labels. Although this corpus has great potential in training deep models with its significant size, there are no baseline reports to date.

This paper investigates the efficacy of different learning models in detecting abusive language. We compare accuracy using the most frequently studied machine learning classifiers as well as recent neural network models. Reliable baseline results are presented with the first comparative study on this dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of different features and variants, and describe the possibility for further improvements with the use of ensemble models. </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Comparative Studies of Detecting Abusive Language on Twitter, What additional features and context are proposed? [/INST] While manually analyzing the raw dataset, we noticed that looking at the tweet one has replied to or has quoted, provides significant contextual information. We call these, â€œcontext tweets". As humans can better understand a tweet with the reference of its context, our assumption is that computers also benefit from taking context tweets into account in detecting abusive language.

As shown in the examples below, (2) is labeled abusive due to the use of vulgar language. However, the intention of the user can be better understood with its context tweet (1).

(1) I hate when I'm sitting in front of the bus and somebody with a wheelchair get on.

INLINEFORM0 (2) I hate it when I'm trying to board a bus and there's already an as**ole on it.

Similarly, context tweet (3) is important in understanding the abusive tweet (4), especially in identifying the target of the malice.

(3) Survivors of #Syria Gas Attack Recount `a Cruel Scene'.

INLINEFORM0 (4) Who the HELL is â€œLIKE" ING this post? Sick people....

Huang et al. huang2016modeling used several attributes of context tweets for sentiment analysis in order to improve the baseline LSTM model. However, their approach was limited because the meta-information they focused onâ€”author information, conversation type, use of the same hashtags or emojisâ€”are all highly dependent on data.

In order to avoid data dependency, text sequences of context tweets are directly used as an additional feature of neural network models. We use the same baseline model to convert context tweets to vectors, then concatenate these vectors with outputs of their corresponding labeled tweets. More specifically, we concatenate max-pooled layers of context and labeled tweets for the CNN baseline model. As for RNN, the last hidden states of context and labeled tweets are concatenated. </s>

Logistic Regression (LR): Linear LR with L2 regularization constant 1 and limited-memory BFGS optimization

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Linear SVM with L2 regularization constant 1 and logistic loss function

Random Forests (RF): Averaging probabilistic predictions of 10 randomized decision trees

Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT): Tree boosting with learning rate 1 and logistic loss function

<s>[INST] In the paper A BERT-Based Transfer Learning Approach for Hate Speech Detection in Online Social Media, Do they report results only on English data? [/INST] We evaluate our method on two widely-studied datasets provided by Waseem and Hovey BIBREF5 and Davidson et al. BIBREF9. Waseem and Hovy BIBREF5 collected $16k$ of tweets based on an initial ad-hoc approach that searched common slurs and terms related to religious, sexual, gender, and ethnic minorities. They annotated their dataset manually as racism, sexism, or neither. To extend this dataset, Waseem BIBREF23 also provided another dataset containing $6.9k$ of tweets annotated with both expert and crowdsourcing users as racism, sexism, neither, or both. Since both datasets are overlapped partially and they used the same strategy in definition of hateful content, we merged these two datasets following Waseem et al. BIBREF10 to make our imbalance data a bit larger. Davidson et al. BIBREF9 used the Twitter API to accumulate 84.4 million tweets from 33,458 twitter users containing particular terms from a pre-defined lexicon of hate speech words and phrases, called Hatebased.org. To annotate collected tweets as Hate, Offensive, or Neither, they randomly sampled $25k$ tweets and asked users of CrowdFlower crowdsourcing platform to label them.

<s>[INST] In the paper A BERT-Based Transfer Learning Approach for Hate Speech Detection in Online Social Media, What new fine-tuning methods are presented? [/INST] 1. BERT based fine-tuning: In the first approach, which is shown in Figure FIGREF8, very few changes are applied to the BERTbase. In this architecture, only the [CLS] token output provided by BERT is used. The [CLS] output, which is equivalent to the [CLS] token output of the 12th transformer encoder, a vector of size 768, is given as input to a fully connected network without hidden layer. The softmax activation function is applied to the hidden layer to classify.

2. Insert nonlinear layers: Here, the first architecture is upgraded and an architecture with a more robust classifier is provided in which instead of using a fully connected network without hidden layer, a fully connected network with two hidden layers in size 768 is used. The first two layers use the Leaky Relu activation function with negative slope = 0.01, but the final layer, as the first architecture, uses softmax activation function as shown in Figure FIGREF8.

3. Insert Bi-LSTM layer: Unlike previous architectures that only use [CLS] as the input for the classifier, in this architecture all outputs of the latest transformer encoder are used in such a way that they are given as inputs to a bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-LSTM) as shown in Figure FIGREF8. After processing the input, the network sends the final hidden state to a fully connected network that performs classification using the softmax activation function.

4. Insert CNN layer: In this architecture shown in Figure FIGREF8, the outputs of all transformer encoders are used instead of using the output of the latest transformer encoder. So that the output vectors of each transformer encoder are concatenated, and a matrix is produced. The convolutional operation is performed with a window of size (3, hidden size of BERT which is 768 in BERTbase model) and the maximum value is generated for each transformer encoder by applying max pooling on the convolution output. By concatenating these values, a vector is generated which is given as input to a fully connected network. By applying softmax on the input, the classification operation is performed. </s>

However, these misclassifications do not confirm the low performance of our classifier because annotators tended to annotate many samples containing disrespectful words as hate or offensive without any presumption about the social context of tweeters such as the speakerâ€™s identity or dialect, whereas they were just offensive or even neither tweets.  </s>

Number of Strongly Connected Components (SCC): a Strongly Connected Component of a directed graph is a maximal (sub)graph where for each pair of vertices $u,v$ there is a path in each direction ($u\rightarrow v$, $v\rightarrow u$).

Size of the Largest Strongly Connected Component (LSCC): the number of nodes in the largest strongly connected component of a given graph.

Number of Weakly Connected Components (WCC): a Weakly Connected Component of a directed graph is a maximal (sub)graph where for each pair of vertices $(u, v)$ there is a path $u \leftrightarrow v$ ignoring edge directions.

Size of the Largest Weakly Connected Component (LWCC): the number of nodes in the largest weakly connected component of a given graph.

Diameter of the Largest Weakly Connected Component (DWCC): the largest distance (length of the shortest path) between two nodes in the (undirected version of) largest weakly connected component of a graph.

Average Clustering Coefficient (CC): the average of the local clustering coefficients of all nodes in a graph; the local clustering coefficient of a node quantifies how close its neighbours are to being a complete graph (or a clique). It is computed according to BIBREF28.

Main K-core Number (KC): a K-core BIBREF13 of a graph is a maximal sub-graph that contains nodes of internal degree $k$ or more; the main K-core number is the highest value of $k$ (in directed graphs the total degree is considered).

Density (d): the density for directed graphs is $d=\frac{|E|}{|V||V-1|}$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges and $|N|$ is the number of vertices in the graph; the density equals 0 for a graph without edges and 1 for a complete graph.

Structural virality of the largest weakly connected component (SV): this measure is defined in BIBREF14 as the average distance between all pairs of nodes in a cascade tree or, equivalently, as the average depth of nodes, averaged over all nodes in turn acting as a root; for $|V| > 1$ vertices, $SV=\frac{1}{|V||V-1|}\sum _i\sum _j d_{ij}$ where $d_{ij}$ denotes the length of the shortest path between nodes $i$ and $j$. This is equivalent to compute the Wiener's index BIBREF29 of the graph and multiply it by a factor $\frac{1}{|V||V-1|}$.

<s>[INST] In the paper Generating Descriptions from Structured Data Using a Bifocal Attention Mechanism and Gated Orthogonalization, What is a bifocal attention mechanism? [/INST] To enable this, we use a bifocal attention mechanism which computes an attention over fields at a macro level and over values at a micro level. We then fuse these attention weights such that the attention weight for a field also influences the attention over the values within it.
Fused Bifocal Attention Mechanism
Intuitively, when a human writes a description from a table she keeps track of information at two levels. At the macro level, it is important to decide which is the appropriate field to attend to next and at a micro level (i.e., within a field) it is important to know which values to attend to next. To capture this behavior, we use a bifocal attention mechanism as described below.
Fused Attention: Intuitively, the attention weights assigned to a field should have an influence on all the values belonging to the particular field. To ensure this, we reweigh the micro level attention weights based on the corresponding macro level attention weights.

<s>[INST] In the paper Combating Adversarial Misspellings with Robust Word Recognition, What is a semicharacter architecture? [/INST] Inspired by the psycholinguistic studies BIBREF5 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF7 proposed a semi-character based RNN (ScRNN) that processes a sentence of words with misspelled characters, predicting the correct words at each step. Let $s = \lbrace w_1, w_2, \dots , w_n\rbrace $ denote the input sentence, a sequence of constituent words $w_i$ . Each input word ( $w_i$ ) is represented by concatenating (i) a one hot vector of the first character ( $\mathbf {w_{i1}}$ ); (ii) a one hot representation of the last character ( $\mathbf {w_{il}}$ , where $l$ is the length of word $w_i$ ); and (iii) a bag of characters representation of the internal characters ( $\sum _{j=2}^{l-1}\mathbf {w_{ij}})$ . ScRNN treats the first and the last characters individually, and is agnostic to the ordering of the internal characters. Each word, represented accordingly, is then fed into a BiLSTM cell. At each sequence step, the training target is the correct corresponding word (output dimension equal to vocabulary size), and the model is optimized with cross-entropy loss. </s>

Backoff to neutral word: Alternatively, noting that passing $\colorbox {gray!20}{\texttt {UNK}}$ -predicted words through unchanged exposes the downstream model to potentially corrupted text, we consider backing off to a neutral word like `a', which has a similar distribution across classes.

Backoff to background model: We also consider falling back upon a more generic word recognition model trained upon a larger, less-specialized corpus whenever the foreground word recognition model predicts UNK. Figure 1 depicts this scenario pictorially. </s>

artificial sources are on average shorter than natural ones: when using BT, cases where the source is shorter than the target are rarer; cases when they have the same length are more frequent.

automatic word alignments between artificial sources tend to be more monotonic than when using natural sources, as measured by the average Kendall INLINEFORM0 of source-target alignments BIBREF22 : for French-English the respective numbers are 0.048 (natural) and 0.018 (artificial); for German-English 0.068 and 0.053.

First, we train BERT on each query-policy sentence pair as a binary classification task to identify if the sentence is evidence for the question or not (Bert). We also experiment with a two-stage classifier, where we separately train the model on questions only to predict answerability. At inference time, if the answerable classifier predicts the question is answerable, the evidence identification classifier produces a set of candidate sentences (Bert + Unanswerable).

 </s>
<s>[INST] In the paper Question Answering for Privacy Policies: Combining Computational and Legal Perspectives, Were other baselines tested to compare with the neural baseline?

The first is a simple bag-of-words set of features over the question (SVM-BOW), the second is bag-of-words features of the question as well as length of the question in words (SVM-BOW + LEN), and lastly we extract bag-of-words features, length of the question in words as well as part-of-speech tags for the question (SVM-BOW + LEN + POS). This results in vectors of 200, 201 and 228 dimensions respectively, which are provided to an SVM with a linear kernel.
No-Answer Baseline (NA) : Most of the questions we receive are difficult to answer in a legally-sound way on the basis of information present in the privacy policy. We establish a simple baseline to quantify the effect of identifying every question as unanswerable.
Word Count Baseline : To quantify the effect of using simple lexical matching to answer the questions, we retrieve the top candidate policy sentences for each question using a word count baseline BIBREF53, which counts the number of question words that also appear in a sentence. We include the top 2, 3 and 5 candidates as baselines.
Human Performance: We pick each reference answer provided by an annotator, and compute the F1 with respect to the remaining references, as described in section 4.2.1. Each reference answer is treated as the prediction, and the remaining n-1 answers are treated as the gold reference. The average of the maximum F1 across all reference answers is computed as the human baseline. </s>

Since oftentimes the questions on StackExchange contain less information than in scientific publications, there are fewer keyphrases per data point in StackEx. Furthermore, StackExchange uses a tag recommendation system that suggests topic-relevant tags to users while submitting questions; therefore, we are more likely to see general terminology such as Linux and Java.

[/INST] The first dataset is an expanded version of the annotated Wikipedia conversations dataset from BIBREF9. This dataset uses carefully-controlled crowdsourced labels, strictly filtered to ensure the conversations are civil up to the moment of a personal attack. This is a useful property for the purposes of model analysis, and hence we focus on this as our primary dataset. However, we are conscious of the possibility that these strict labels may not fully capture the kind of behavior that moderators care about in practice. We therefore introduce a secondary dataset, constructed from the subreddit ChangeMyView (CMV) that does not use post-hoc annotations. Instead, the prediction task is to forecast whether the conversation will be subject to moderator action in the future.
Wikipedia data. BIBREF9's `Conversations Gone Awry' dataset consists of 1,270 conversations that took place between Wikipedia editors on publicly accessible talk pages. The conversations are sourced from the WikiConv dataset BIBREF59 and labeled by crowdworkers as either containing a personal attack from within (i.e., hostile behavior by one user in the conversation directed towards another) or remaining civil throughout.
Reddit CMV data. The CMV dataset is constructed from conversations collected via the Reddit API. In contrast to the Wikipedia-based dataset, we explicitly avoid the use of post-hoc annotation. Instead, we use as our label whether a conversation eventually had a comment removed by a moderator for violation of Rule 2: â€œDon't be rude or hostile to other usersâ€. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Semi-supervised Thai Sentence Segmentation Using Local and Distant Word Representations, How do they utilize unlabeled data to improve model representations? [/INST] CVT BIBREF20 is a semi-supervised learning technique whose goal is to improve the model representation using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. During training, the model is trained alternately with one mini-batch of labeled data and INLINEFORM0 mini-batches of unlabeled data.
Labeled data are input into the model to calculate the standard supervised loss for each mini-batch and the model weights are updated regularly. Meanwhile, each mini-batch of unlabeled data is selected randomly from the pool of all unlabeled data; the model computes the loss for CVT from the mini-batch of unlabeled data. This CVT loss is used to train auxiliary prediction modules, which see restricted views of the input, to match the output of the primary prediction module, which is the full model that sees all the input. Meanwhile, the auxiliary prediction modules share the same intermediate representation with the primary prediction module. Hence, the intermediate representation of the model is improved through this process.
As discussed in Section SECREF3 , CVT requires primary and auxiliary prediction modules for training with unlabeled data to improve the representation. Thus, we construct both types of prediction modules for our model. The flow of unlabeled data, which is processed to obtain a prediction by each module, is shown in Fig. . The output of each prediction module is transformed into the probability distribution of each class by the softmax function and then used to calculate INLINEFORM0 , as shown in cvtloss.

<s>[INST] In the paper Exploration Based Language Learning for Text-Based Games, How better does new approach behave than existing solutions? [/INST] Results ::: CoinCollector
In this setting, we compare the number of actions played in the environment (frames) and the score achieved by the agent (i.e. +1 reward if the coin is collected). In Go-Explore we also count the actions used to restore the environment to a selected cell, i.e. to bring the agent to the state represented in the selected cell. This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively.
In case of Game CoinCollector, 
In CookingWorld, we compared models in the three settings mentioned earlier, namely, single, joint, and zero-shot. In all experiments, we measured the sum of the final scores of all the games and their trajectory length (number of steps). Table TABREF26 summarizes the results in these three settings. Phase 1 of Go-Explore on single games achieves a total score of 19,530 (sum over all games), which is very close to the maximum possible points (i.e. 19,882), with 47,562 steps. A winning trajectory was found in 4,279 out of the total of 4,440 games. This result confirms again that the exploration strategy of Go-Explore is effective in text-based games. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of the simple imitation learning policy trained using the extracted trajectories in phase 1 of Go-Explore in the three settings mentioned above.
In this setting, each model is trained from scratch in each of the 4,440 games based on the trajectory found in phase 1 of Go-Explore (previous step). As shown in Table TABREF26, the LSTM-DQN BIBREF7, BIBREF8 approach without the use of admissible actions performs poorly. One explanation for this could be that it is difficult for this model to explore both language and game strategy at the same time; it is hard for the model to find a reward signal before it has learned to model language, since almost none of its actions will be admissible, and those reward signals are what is necessary in order to learn the language model. As we see in Table TABREF26, however, by using the admissible actions in the $\epsilon $-greedy step the score achieved by the LSTM-DQN increases dramatically (+ADM row in Table TABREF26). DRRN BIBREF10 achieves a very high score, since it explicitly learns how to rank admissible actions (i.e. a much simpler task than generating text). Finally, our approach of using a Seq2Seq model trained on the single trajectory provided by phase 1 of Go-Explore achieves the highest score among all the methods, even though we do not use admissible actions in this phase. However, in this experiment the Seq2Seq model cannot perfectly replicate the provided trajectory and the total score that it achieves is in fact 9.4% lower compared to the total score achieved by phase 1 of Go-Explore. Figure FIGREF61 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows the score breakdown for each level and model, where we can see that the gap between our model and other methods increases as the games become harder in terms of skills needed.
In this setting the 4,440 games are split into training, validation, and test games. The split is done randomly but in a way that different difficulty levels (recipes 1, 2 and 3), are represented with equal ratios in all the 3 splits, i.e. stratified by difficulty. As shown in Table TABREF26, the zero-shot performance of the RL baselines is poor, which could be attributed to the same reasons why RL baselines under-perform in the Joint case. Especially interesting is that the performance of DRRN is substantially lower than that of the Go-Explore Seq2Seq model, even though the DRRN model has access to the admissible actions at test time, while the Seq2Seq model (as well as the LSTM-DQN model) has to construct actions token-by-token from the entire vocabulary of 20,000 tokens. On the other hand, Go-Explore Seq2Seq shows promising results by solving almost half of the unseen games. Figure FIGREF62 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows that most of the lost games are in the hardest set, where a very long sequence of actions is required for winning the game. These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games. </s>

[/INST] All corpora provide datasets/splits for answer selection, whereas only (WikiQA, SQuAD) and (WikiQA, SelQA) provide datasets for answer extraction and answer triggering, respectively. SQuAD is much larger in size although questions in this corpus are often paraphrased multiple times. On the contrary, SQuAD's average candidates per question ( INLINEFORM0 ) is the smallest because SQuAD extracts answer candidates from paragraphs whereas the others extract them from sections or infoboxes that consist of bigger contexts. Although InfoboxQA is larger than WikiQA or SelQA, the number of token types ( INLINEFORM1 ) in InfoboxQA is smaller than those two, due to the repetitive nature of infoboxes.

All corpora show similar average answer candidate lengths ( INLINEFORM0 ), except for InfoboxQA where each line in the infobox is considered a candidate. SelQA and SQuAD show similar average question lengths ( INLINEFORM1 ) because of the similarity between their annotation schemes. It is not surprising that WikiQA's average question length is the smallest, considering their questions are taken from search queries. InfoboxQA's average question length is relatively small, due to the restricted information that can be asked from the infoboxes. InfoboxQA and WikiQA show the least question-answer word overlaps over questions and answers ( INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 in Table TABREF2 ), respectively. In terms of the F1-score for overlapping words ( INLINEFORM4 ), SQuAD gives the least portion of overlaps between question-answer pairs although WikiQA comes very close. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper PitchNet: Unsupervised Singing Voice Conversion with Pitch Adversarial Network, How is the quality of singing voice measured? [/INST] To compare the conversions between USVC and PitchNet, we employed an automatic evaluation score and a human evaluation score.
The automatic score roughly followed the design in BIBREF13. The pitch tracker of librosa package BIBREF18 was employed to extract pitch information of the input and output audio. Then the output pitch was compared to the input pitch using the normalized cross correlation (NCC) which would give a score between 0 and 1. The higher the score is, the better the output pitch matches the input pitch. We conducted the evaluation on USVC (our) and PitchNet. The evaluated automatic scores on conversion and reconstruction tasks are shown in Tab. TABREF14. Our method performed better both on conversion and reconstruction. The scores of reconstruction are higher than conversion since both models were trained using a reconstruction loss. However, the score of our method on conversion is even higher than the score of USVC (Our) on reconstruction.
Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was used as a subjective metric to evaluate the quality of the converted audio. Two questions were asked: (1) what is quality of the audio? (naturalness) (2) How well does the converted version match the original? (similarity) A score of 1-5 would be given to answer the questions. The evaluation was conducted on USVC (Our) and PitchNet. Besides, the converted samples provided by BIBREF0 was also included to give a more convincing evaluation. As shown by Tab. TABREF15, the naturalness and similarity of our method are both higher than the other two ones. Our implementation of USVC performed slightly lower than the original author's because we cannot fully reproduce the results of them.
Next we qualitatively analyze the influence of input pitch in our method. We used different pitch as input to observe how the output pitch would change along with the input pitch. The input pitch was multiplied by 0.7, 1.0 and 1.3 respectively. And the output pitch was also extracted by the pitch tracker of the librosa package. Fig. FIGREF16 plots the pitch of input audio and output audio with different pitch as input while keeping the target singer the same. As shown by Fig. FIGREF16, the output pitch changes significantly along with the input pitch. The examples are also presented at our website. </s>

<s>[INST] In the paper Translation Artifacts in Cross-lingual Transfer Learning, What are examples of these artificats? [/INST] Instead, our analysis reveals that this behavior is caused by subtle artifacts arising from the translation process itself. In particular, we show that translating different parts of each instance separately (e.g. the premise and the hypothesis in NLI) can alter superficial patterns in the data (e.g. the degree of lexical overlap between them), which severely affects the generalization ability of current models. Based on the gained insights, we improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI, and show that some previous findings need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon.
The benchmark consists of a competence test, which evaluates the ability to understand antonymy relation and perform numerical reasoning, a distraction test, which evaluates the robustness to shallow patterns like lexical overlap and the presence of negation words, and a noise test, which evaluates robustness to spelling errors. Just as with previous experiments, we report results for the best epoch checkpoint in each test set. </s>

Our quantitative results show that sharing the context vectors provides better results, and that amortization and hierarchical structure give further improvements.
Data. We apply the sefe on three datasets: ArXiv papers, U.S. Senate speeches, and purchases on supermarket grocery shopping data. We describe these datasets below, and we provide a summary of the datasets in Table TABREF17 .
ArXiv papers: This dataset contains the abstracts of papers published on the ArXiv under the 19 different tags between April 2007 and June 2015. We treat each tag as a group and fit sefe with the goal of uncovering which words have the strongest shift in usage. We split the abstracts into training, validation, and test sets, with proportions of INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 , and INLINEFORM2 , respectively.

Senate speeches: This dataset contains U.S. Senate speeches from 1994 to mid 2009. In contrast to the ArXiv collection, it is a transcript of spoken language. We group the data into state of origin of the speaker and his or her party affiliation. Only affiliations with the Republican and Democratic Party are considered. As a result, there are 83 groups (Republicans from Alabama, Democrats from Alabama, Republicans from Arkansas, etc.). Some of the state/party combinations are not available in the data, as some of the 50 states have only had Senators with the same party affiliation. We split the speeches into training ( INLINEFORM0 ), validation ( INLINEFORM1 ), and testing ( INLINEFORM2 ).

Grocery shopping data: This dataset contains the purchases of INLINEFORM0 customers. The data covers a period of 97 weeks. After removing low-frequency items, the data contains INLINEFORM1 unique items at the 1.10upc (Universal Product Code) level. We split the data into a training, test, and validation sets, with proportions of INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 , and INLINEFORM4 , respectively. The training data contains INLINEFORM5 shopping trips and INLINEFORM6 purchases in total.
For the text corpora, we fix the vocabulary to the 15k most frequent terms and remove all words that are not in the vocabulary. Following BIBREF2 , we additionally remove each word with probability INLINEFORM0 , where INLINEFORM1 is the word frequency. This downsamples especially the frequent words and speeds up training. (Sizes reported in Table TABREF17 are the number of words remaining after preprocessing.)
Models. Our goal is to fit the sefe model on these datasets. For the text data, we use the Bernoulli distribution as the conditional exponential family, while for the shopping data we use the Poisson distribution, which is more appropriate for count data.

<s>[INST] In the paper How we do things with words: Analyzing text as social and cultural data, What kind of issues (that are not on the forefront of computational text analysis) do they tackle? [/INST] We typically start by identifying the questions we wish to explore. Can text analysis provide a new perspective on a â€œbig questionâ€ that has been attracting interest for years? Or can we raise new questions that have only recently emerged, for example about social media? For social scientists working in computational analysis, the questions are often grounded in theory, asking: How can we explain what we observe?
Computational analysis of text motivated by these questions is insight driven: we aim to describe a phenomenon or explain how it came about. For example, what can we learn about how and why hate speech is used or how this changes over time? Is hate speech one thing, or does it comprise multiple forms of expression? Is there a clear boundary between hate speech and other types of speech, and what features make it more or less ambiguous?
Sometimes we also hope to connect to multiple disciplines. For example, while focusing on the humanistic concerns of an archive, we could also ask social questions such as â€œis this archive more about collaborative processes, culture-building or norm creation?â€ or â€œhow well does this archive reflect the society in which it is embedded?"
